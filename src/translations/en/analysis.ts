This feeling of wanting to win, wanting to control, wanting to decide, is not willfulness, it's awakening.",
      "命宫.HuaKe.description": "Your wisdom, speech, and logical thinking will become your most shining label. Others will look at you with new eyes because of your expression, temperament, and knowledge. This is not pretending to have substance, this is you deserving to be understood.",
