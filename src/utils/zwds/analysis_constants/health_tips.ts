      "The head is your command center, housing your thoughts, focus, and identity. When stress piles up or responsibilities become too heavy, your head often takes the hit — manifesting as headaches, tension, or mental fog. While rest and hydration are essential, what’s even more powerful is learning to manage overthinking, perfectionism, and the need to control everything. Give your mind breaks from judgment and pressure. Embrace stillness, creative outlets, and conscious breathing. When you allow space for mental quiet, clarity returns — and your head becomes a source of light, not weight.",

  眼: {
    chinese_name: "眼",
    english_name: "Eyes",
    associated_stars: ["太阳"],
    description:
      "Your eyes do more than see — they reflect how you perceive life and what you choose to focus on. In this age of screens and overstimulation, your vision can blur not just physically, but metaphorically. Fatigue, strain, and dryness often signal the need to look away and reassess your view. It's not just about reducing screen time; it's about choosing what you consume visually and emotionally. Surround yourself with beauty, with perspective, with light. When you protect what enters through your eyes, your vision — both literal and internal — sharpens with renewed purpose.",

  心脏: {
    chinese_name: "心脏",
    english_name: "Heart",
    associated_stars: ["太阳", "天机"],
    description:
      "The heart doesn’t just pump blood — it processes passion, emotion, and your sense of connection. A racing heart often reflects more than physical activity; it reveals anxiety, unresolved tension, or deep longing. Heart health improves with movement, but also with emotional honesty. Don’t bottle up affection or anger; let feelings move freely, like your blood should. Laugh deeply, grieve openly, love sincerely. When your emotional life finds rhythm and expression, your heart responds in kind — beating not just to keep you alive, but to remind you that you are truly living.",

  鼻: {
    chinese_name: "鼻",
    english_name: "Nose",
    associated_stars: ["武曲"],
    description:
      "Your nose is the gateway of breath and the keeper of intuition. When it’s blocked or hypersensitive, it may be your body’s way of asking you to slow down and reconnect. Breathing is your most vital, yet often overlooked, form of nourishment. Beyond allergies or colds, nasal issues often mirror mental rigidity or an unwillingness to “smell” the truth. Practice breathing with awareness — long, deep, and steady. Engage with nature and scents that ground you. When you give your nose a chance to relax, your whole body begins to breathe easier — literally and emotionally.",
  },
  肺: {
    chinese_name: "肺",
    english_name: "Lungs",
    associated_stars: ["武曲"],
    description:
      "Your lungs are where you meet the world — breath by breath. They hold not only oxygen but also unspoken grief and unprocessed emotion. When you feel stifled, anxious, or like you’re carrying too much, your breath often becomes shallow or tight. Strengthening your lungs isn’t just about cardio — it’s about giving yourself emotional space to inhale deeply and exhale completely. Practice releasing what no longer serves you, with each breath a quiet act of letting go. When your lungs are open, you reclaim your capacity to live fully, speak clearly, and move through life with resilience.",

  骨: {
    chinese_name: "骨",
    english_name: "Bones",
    associated_stars: ["武曲", "贪狼"],
    description:
      "Your bones represent structure, stability, and the foundation of your strength. When they ache or weaken, it's often a message about how you’re carrying the weight of life. Are you overburdened? Are you trying to stand tall without support? Bone health depends on more than calcium — it thrives on aligned living, proper rest, and knowing when to lean on others. Give your body grounding through movement, your spirit steadiness through routine, and your mind a break from pressure. When you honor your own backbone — both physically and metaphorically — you become unshakable from the inside out.",

  口: {
    chinese_name: "口",
    english_name: "Mouth",
    associated_stars: ["巨门"],
    description:
      "Your mouth is where thoughts become words, where expression meets the outer world. When tension builds here — in the form of dryness, sores, or jaw clenching — it’s often tied to what you’re holding back or forcing yourself to say. The health of your mouth isn’t just about hygiene, but about voice. Are you being honest? Are you speaking too much, or not enough? Nourish this space by speaking with intention, eating with presence, and allowing silence when needed. When your words come from alignment rather than habit, your mouth becomes a place of empowerment, not exhaustion.",

  肠: {
    chinese_name: "肠",
    english_name: "Intestines",
    associated_stars: ["巨门", "七杀", "破军"],
    description:
      "Your intestines are the deepest part of your gut — they digest not just food, but life’s experiences. When your system is off — through cramps, bloating, or irregularity — it often signals that something emotional is unresolved. The gut responds to anxiety faster than the mind, often mirroring your inner unease. While fiber and hydration help, your digestion also needs emotional clarity and routine. Create rhythms in your day, clear out toxic thoughts, and trust your intuition. When your gut feels safe and heard, it returns the favor by becoming a steady source of energy, clarity, and strength.",

  耳: {
    chinese_name: "耳",
    english_name: "Ears",
    associated_stars: ["天同"],
    description:
      "Your ears are not just tools for hearing — they reflect how well you receive the world. When they ring, ache, or close off, it may be a sign that you’re overwhelmed by noise — not just literal, but emotional and social as well. Listening is an act of energy exchange, and too much intake without pause can lead to exhaustion or misalignment. Create moments of quiet. Choose carefully what and who you listen to. Protect your peace as much as your sense of sound. When your ears are honored with silence and sincerity, they open you up to wisdom beyond words.",

  膀胱: {
    chinese_name: "膀胱",
    english_name: "Bladder",
    associated_stars: ["天同"],
    description:
      "Your bladder is deeply tied to your ability to release and let go — not just physically, but emotionally. When issues arise here, it often reflects inner tension, a fear of vulnerability, or holding onto what should be released. Hydration and warmth support the bladder, but so does emotional cleansing. What emotional baggage are you holding? What do you need to let flow freely? Practicing healthy boundaries and honoring your emotional cycles can ease the strain. When you learn to let go safely and steadily, your bladder, and your entire body, feels more at ease and in rhythm.",

  血液: {
    chinese_name: "血液",
    english_name: "Blood",
    associated_stars: ["廉贞"],
    description:
      "Your blood is the river of life, carrying not only nutrients but vitality, identity, and inherited patterns. When circulation is poor or your blood feels “heavy,” it may signal stress, internal conflict, or disconnection from purpose. Blood health is influenced by how passionately you live and how deeply you connect to your roots. Are you living with alignment? Do you allow joy and movement to flow through your days? Nourish your blood with warmth, rhythm, and expression. When your life-force flows freely, your body remembers its strength — and your spirit remembers its mission.",

  生殖器: {
    chinese_name: "生殖器",
    english_name: "Reproductive System",
    associated_stars: ["廉贞", "贪狼"],
    description:
      "Your reproductive system is about more than creation — it reflects your relationship with power, pleasure, and personal boundaries. When imbalances show up here, it may point to unresolved shame, disempowerment, or creative blockages. Hormonal health thrives on more than diet; it needs emotional safety, self-respect, and permission to feel desire without judgment. Reclaiming this part of yourself isn’t indulgence — it’s healing. When you embrace your creative energy without fear, you access not only physical vitality but a deeper sense of wholeness and self-trust.",

  神经系统: {
    chinese_name: "神经系统",
    english_name: "Nervous System",
    associated_stars: ["廉贞", "天机", "文昌", "文曲"],
    description:
      "Your nervous system is your internal messenger, interpreting every signal from the world. It responds not just to stimuli, but to your inner narrative — fear, urgency, pressure. When your nerves are frayed, it’s often a sign that your boundaries have been breached or your life lacks safety. Healing here isn’t about numbing; it’s about regulation. Breathe slowly, simplify your days, say no more often. Let stillness become a friend. When you learn to soothe your nervous system gently and consistently, it becomes your ally in clarity, presence, and sustainable action.",

  肝脏: {
    chinese_name: "肝脏",
    english_name: "Liver",
    associated_stars: ["太阴", "贪狼"],
    description:
      "Your liver is the body’s processor — metabolizing not just physical substances, but also suppressed emotions like anger and frustration. When your liver is imbalanced, you may feel irritable, sluggish, or emotionally stuck. Detoxing isn't only about food; it's about clearing resentment, setting emotional boundaries, and giving yourself permission to express instead of internalize. Let your days include laughter, movement, and moments to release tension. When your inner life flows without blockage, your liver follows — becoming a cleaner, clearer filter that supports your vitality and emotional freedom.",
  },
  肾: {
    chinese_name: "肾",
    english_name: "Kidneys",
    associated_stars: ["贪狼"],
    description:
      "Your kidneys are your reserves — managing energy, fear, and long-term resilience. When they’re taxed, it may show up as fatigue, lower back pain, or anxiety rooted in insecurity. Nourishing your kidneys means more than staying warm or drinking enough water. It also involves restoring your inner sense of safety and confidence. Do you feel supported? Are you pushing past your limits too often? Rest is not a luxury; it's a necessity. When you rebuild trust in yourself and create safe, sustainable rhythms, your kidneys refill with quiet power — fueling your strength from the deepest layers.",

  筋骨: {
    chinese_name: "筋骨",
    english_name: "Tendons & Muscles",
    associated_stars: ["贪狼"],
    description:
      "Your tendons and muscles are the bridge between movement and stability — reflecting how you act, adapt, and respond under pressure. Tension here often mirrors emotional rigidity or over-effort. Flexibility isn’t just physical; it’s mental and emotional too. Stretching, rest, and strength-building are essential, but so is learning to soften in moments of control. Do you allow yourself to change direction? To bend without breaking? When your muscles feel supported and your movements become intentional, you regain fluidity — not just in your body, but in your entire way of being.",
  },
  手: {
    chinese_name: "手",
    english_name: "Hands",
    associated_stars: ["天机"],
    description:
      "Your hands are extensions of your mind and spirit — tools for creation, connection, and contribution. When tension or numbness shows up here, it can signal overexertion or a disconnection from what truly matters to you. Are you grasping too tightly? Giving more than you’re receiving? Hand health improves when you balance doing with being — allowing space to create from inspiration rather than obligation. Let your hands rest, play, and touch the world with care. When aligned with purpose, your hands become more than instruments — they become expressions of your soul.",
  },
  脚: {
    chinese_name: "脚",
    english_name: "Feet",
    associated_stars: ["天机"],
    description:
      "Your feet are your foundation — how you move forward and where you find grounding. Pain or instability here often reflects feeling unsupported or uncertain in life’s direction. Strong, healthy feet rely on more than shoes; they need balance in your choices, a pace that matches your energy, and moments of stillness to reorient. Walk in nature, reconnect with the earth, and check in with your personal path. When your feet feel secure, you begin to walk not just with purpose — but with peace.",
  },
  膝盖: {
    chinese_name: "膝盖",
    english_name: "Knees",
    associated_stars: ["天相"],
    description:
      "Your knees represent humility, flexibility, and the ability to move through change with grace. Pain or stiffness often signals resistance — to change, to support, or to emotional surrender. Knee health depends on both physical mobility and psychological adaptability. Are you holding yourself too rigidly? Are you afraid to ask for help? Learn to bend, to yield, to shift with life’s demands instead of bracing against them. When you honor your knees as guides through transition, they return the favor with freedom, stability, and quiet strength.",

  关节: {
    chinese_name: "关节",
    english_name: "Joints",
    associated_stars: ["文昌", "文曲", "天梁"],
    description:
      "Your joints are where movement meets coordination — reflecting how well your life flows from one phase to the next. Stiffness or pain often points to stuckness, indecision, or internal resistance. Healthy joints need both strength and ease, effort and rest. Let your routines support fluidity rather than rigidity. Practice flexibility in mind and schedule. Release what's no longer serving you. When your inner world flows smoothly, your joints follow — allowing you to pivot, stretch, and evolve with greater ease and grace.",

  胃: {

    english_name: "Stomach",
    associated_stars: ["太阳", "天机"],
    description:
    "Your stomach is your source of nourishment — how you digest not just food, but life’s experiences. When it’s off, it often reflects a lack of emotional safety or a fear of vulnerability. Nourishing your stomach isn’t just about eating well; it’s about creating a life that nourishes your spirit. Practice gratitude, find joy in small things, and allow yourself to receive. When your inner life is rich and your physical body is healthy, your stomach becomes a source of strength, not strain.",
