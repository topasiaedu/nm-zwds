[See if below need talk]
By the way… Before we dive in, type in the chat, let me know 📍 Where are you joining from? 💼 And… what do you do?
***after read some comment***
Awesome, coming from Different backgrounds, different industries — but do you see, everyone here tonight has one thing in common: You want to make better decisions about your life and wealth, based on a structure, not struggle.
And I really appreciate that you’ve chosen to spend this 2 days here with me. Some of you maybe it’s after work, after family time, after meetings — that’s a commitment, and I won’t take this for granted, and im gonna make sure this 2 days is gonna be well worth your time.
Now whether you like it or not, we’re living in a time where the world is moving faster than ever.It’s not the time to stay stuck in the past.
The way we invest, the way we plan things — it’s no longer the same as before. Would you agree… the world is changing faster than ever?
We’ve got access to more tools, more knowledge, and more resources than any generation before us.
And if the world is moving fast — we can’t afford to stay slow.
We need to evolve just as quickly, or risk being left behind. If you agree type YES in the chat.
Good.
So this system, is exactly your GPS. Just like when we drive on the road, we need a map, we need a GPS right, especially when you drive in KL, if without a map, you’re gonna get loss easily
That’s why understanding your timing and having a map is essential. so you never waste another year going in circles.
Alright, now just so we’re clear from the start:This platform is built on full transparency.
If something works, we’ll tell you it works.If something doesn’t, we’ll tell you it doesn’t.Everything you’ll hear over the next two days comes from real experience — from reading charts of highly successful people… to everyday people just like us.
So this isn’t theory — it’s what actually happens in real life.
Now let me ask you this honestly —Have you ever joined a webinar and the whole time you’re listening,you’re sitting there wondering, “Are they going to start selling something later?”And because of that, it makes you unable to even focus the entire session?
If that’s happened to you before, just type a “1” in the chat.
Yeah — I get it.That’s why we want to be upfront with you.
At the end of this session, if what I share makes sense for you, and you find it valuable and if you want to go deeper, there will be an opportunity to join our coaching program. You can decide if you're gonna join.
But… only if it speaks to you.  because we’re all adults here, we can make our own decisions.
But if you’re not interested, that’s completely fine too.
You can just cover your ears for a moment and join back for the Q&A.
I’ll only spend about 10 minutes on it, and the rest of our time is focused on giving you as much value as possible.”
Fair enough?
If that sounds fair — type “FAIR” in the chat.
Alright — I think we’re ready.
Grab your pen & paper, and let’s get started

DECODE YOUR WEALTH DNA
DAY 1
“On Day 1, we’ll uncover your Wealth DNA — the code written into your destiny. It reveals your default blueprint… how you naturally attract, create, and sustain wealth.
If you’re here to understand your true wealth path — to discover the hidden weapon that’s been in your chart all along — type 1 in the chat.”


Who here has ever worked really hard in your business —                                AND still wonder why the growth doesn’t match the effort, the spend, or the sacrifice?
Founder Timing Decision System™
“What we’re about to talk about today… is extremely powerful. It’s about your Wealth Path — something that, once you see it, could completely shift how you move in 2026 and beyond.
Now, let me ask you this…Who here has ever worked really hard in your business —  AND still wonder why the growth doesn’t match the effort, the spend, or the sacrifice?You followed what “should” work…
You invested time, energy, team, ads, systems…
But the results? Not matching the effort.

Type ‘YES’ in the chat if that sounds familiar.

You see, you’re not alone. And it’s not because you’re not capable or that you didn’t try hard enough… It’s simply because you’ve been playing in the wrong lane.
So today, as we begin Day 1 of this bootcamp — we’re going to help founders and business owners like you to finally discover your Wealth DNA using a high precision system called ziweidoushu — the lane that’s truly meant for you.”


WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT?
Founder Timing Decision System™
Now let me show you why this is different.
This is not fortune telling.  It’s not about personality tests, fixed fate, or feel-good advice. It’s about something far more powerful:
What you’re about to unlock next is a …
A strategic timing decision system made specially for dounders — built from your unique timing and energetic structure — to help you make faster, clearer, better business decisions.
When I started decoding my own chart… I realized: I wasn’t failing because I lacked discipline. I wasn’t stuck because I needed more motivation.
I was simply making decisions out of season.
So here’s few examples:
When I hired during a Winter cycle, people come and go very easily without any reasons When I launched something new when my chart said pause, that plan fails immediatelyAnd when I scaled before I had the right support, profit shrink very quick And I burned a lot money on my entrepreneurial journey — not because the idea was bad — but because the timing was wrong.
“If this saves you one failed launch, one wrong hire, or even one month of delay — it’s already paid for itself.”
The moment I aligned to the timing of my own chart — everything changed.
That’s when I built multiple 7-figure businesses… not through luck, and not through hustle… but by using strategy that was already written in my DNA.





WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT?
NOT THEORY
Founder Timing Decision System™
What I’m sharing with you in these 3 days… is not metaphysical theory. It’s a real-world decision framework used by business owners, founders, and high performers.
You’ll learn how to: ✅ Time your launches ✅ Hire with clarity ✅ Know when to invest, and when to hold ✅ Align your offers to your wealth season ✅ And stop burning resources in cycles that aren’t designed for growth

Because at the end of the day — you don’t want to “know your chart.” You want to move with confidence. You want to know: → “Is this the right time?” → “Am I building the right thing?” → “Where am I supposed to double down — and what should I drop?”
That’s what Zi Wei Dou Shu can do — when used as a strategy tool.

So let me ask you this…
If you could use your chart to make better business decisions… and finally stop guessing — would that be valuable to you?
✅ If yes, type “YES” in the chat right now.






Founder Timing Decision System™
Imagine a founder behind the wheel —
they’ve stepped hard on the gas pedal.
Burning the fuel, pouring in the effort, the capital
They’ve hired. They’ve launched. They’ve scaled.
But the business?
It’s barely moving.


Founder Timing Decision System™
“Think about it. Have you ever seen someone working day and night… yet their life never really changes? Or maybe you’ve felt it yourself — hustling non-stop, but stuck at the same level.
It’s not because they’re lazy. It’s because their vehicle doesn’t match their DNA.
What does that mean? It means if you’re in the wrong lane, you’ll be like that Ferrari just now — engine loud, fuel burning, effort maxed out… but not moving forward. Wasting years of your time.
But when you’re in the right lane, everything feels different. Every step compounds. Effort multiplies. Wealth accelerates.
Can you see how being in the wrong vehicle leads to burnout — no matter how hard you push?”
Chat engagement: “Type YES if you’ve ever felt this before.” [Pause, read names and YESes out loud, build energy in the room.]



Business Owners,
2025 was the warning,
2026 will be the REAL TEST
Founder Timing Decision System™




2025 Is Reshuffling Everything
2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9
Team churn and hiring delays
Offer fatigue and repositioning
More ad spend, less ROI
Uncertainty around market fit
“Everything used to work… but now?”
Founder Timing Decision System™
We are officially in Period 9 — a 20-year cycle of intense speed, volatility, and visibility. If 2025 already feels unstable, there’s a reason for that.
2 + 0 + 2 + 5 = 9. And 9 in metaphysics means restructuring, reshuffling, revealing.
That’s why many business owners this year are:
Rebuilding teams
Reworking offers
Questioning if they’re in the right market
Burning more cash with less clarity
But it’s not over.




2026 Is a New Reset of Business Cycle
2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 1 
Founder Timing Decision System™
2026 adds up to 1.
Which means a full reset.
The beginning of new business cycles.
The start of new winners… and quiet exits.
“If you don’t adapt your strategy — and your decisions — to this new cycle, you’ll carry the same problems into a new era… and get the same results.”



The New Era Requires a New System
What Most Founders Don’t Have… 
Is a Timing Decision System
Founder Timing Decision System™
Most founders don’t fail because they’re lazy. They fail because they’re building without a system. They hire by gut. Launch by guessing. Invest because others are. Scale in the wrong seasons.
“Most failures in Period 9… won’t come from bad ideas.
They’ll come from decisions made at the wrong time.”
That’s why I created the Founder Timing Decision System™ — a strategy framework that helps founders:
✅ Make smarter business moves ✅ In the right season ✅ Aligned with their Wealth DNA ✅ Based on their personal timing cycle

Old Belief
New Belief
What Got You Here… Will Not Get You Through Period 9
If you think this is useful, helpful to you far, write down in your notebook today 
“After consulting over a thousand clients, I’ve realized something: Most people today are not short of effort. You’ve worked late nights, tried different things, pushed harder than before.
But here’s the belief many people still hold onto: 👉 ‘If I’m not getting results, I just need to work harder. Longer hours. Push more.’
The truth? It’s not about effort. The real problem is misalignment.
If your DNA doesn’t match the vehicle you’re using to create wealth, no amount of work will move the needle. It’s like flooring the accelerator in the wrong gear — the harder you push, the louder the engine screams… but you don’t go faster.
So can you see? The real issue isn’t lack of effort… it’s being in the wrong lane.”
Chat Engagement: “Type YES if you’ve ever worked hard, but the results still didn’t match the effort.”
One of the biggest reason that you still don’t see any result right now - it’s mainly because you’re still holding the old belief now, 
Today i’ll reveal most updated approach, new belief so you can kickstart 2026 strong, and maximize your 2025, how many of you want that, type 2026 in the chat now!



What Got You Here…Will Not Get You Through Period 9
Old Belief
New Belief
Founder Timing Decision System™
Let’s be honest — most of what we’ve been taught about business growth comes from a world where timing didn’t matter.
Just work harder. Just launch more. Just pivot. Just hire faster. Just reinvest.
But we’re not in that world anymore.
In Period 9, the cost of one wrong move — one wrong launch, one wrong hire, one misaligned offer — is months of recovery.
And here’s the truth:
Most business failures don’t come from bad strategy — they come from bad timing.
You didn’t fail because you’re not capable. You failed because you were pressing the gas in the wrong season.




What Got You Here…Will Not Get You Through Period 9
❌ Old Belief
✅ New Belief
“If I just launch more, I’ll grow.”
“If I launch at the wrong time, I burn capital.”
“Scaling means hiring.”
“Scaling means aligning with my timing & energy.”
“I just need better ads or funnels.”
“If I’m in Winter, I should focus on upskilling.”
“The market isn’t ready.”
“I wasn’t in my cycle to lead this move.”
“More hustle = more results.”
“More hustle in the wrong season = burnout.”
“I’ll pivot my way to clarity.”
“Pivoting without timing is another dead end.”
“I hire based on role.”
“I hire based on my leadership style & cycle needs.”
Let’s be honest — most of what we’ve been taught about business growth comes from a world where timing didn’t matter.
Just work harder. Just launch more. Just pivot. Just hire faster. Just reinvest.
But we’re not in that world anymore.
In Period 9, the cost of one wrong move — one wrong launch, one wrong hire, one misaligned offer — is months of recovery.
And here’s the truth:
Most business failures don’t come from bad strategy — they come from bad timing.
You didn’t fail because you’re not capable. You failed because you were pressing the gas in the wrong season.

We’re building your Founder Timing Decision System™, mastering the six core pillars that help you to win in 2026  — The system that helps business owners stop wasting moves… and start scaling with precision, not pressure.
But here's the truth:
This only works if you stay the full 3 days — because each day builds on the next.
So let me ask you — how many of you are truly committed to staying for the full experience, to getting your strategy dialed in, to stop guessing, and finally move with clarity?
If that’s you, type ‘3’ in the chat right now.
(Pause — read the names, build momentum)
You’re not making a promise to me. You’re making a promise to yourself — your future, your business, your legacy.
Because real founders don’t flinch halfway. They finish what they start. They stay committed to their own breakthroughs. And they take action when others hesitate.


How I Discover…
Founder Timing Decision System™
Now some of you might be thinking —
“This system sounds powerful… But how did you discover all this out, CAE?”
So before we go deeper — Let me take a moment to share how I went from a mindless founder… Fast forward to building multiple businesses today — using nothing but strategy, timing, and this system.



What You See Now…
Founder Timing Decision System™
Today, people see the external wins. Multiple income streams. International clients. Business trips.  A lean, scalable business that still grows even while I’m away.
They see the clarity. They see the confidence. They see the momentum.
They see the transformation. Some people say this is “luck”
But most people never ask — “What actually created that kind of growth?” Because it wasn’t hustle. And it wasn’t luck.



What Most People Don’t See
Founder Timing Decision System™
What most people don’t know is… I didn’t grow up with a silver spoon. I didn’t have money, or connections, or investors backing me.
In fact — it was the opposite.
I watched my family’s business collapse — not from laziness or poor effort —
but from one wrong decision at the wrong time.
It wiped out everything they’d built over 20 years. 
That moment burned into my memory.
It taught me this:
In business, even one mistimed move…
can undo years of hard work.


The Pattern I Couldn’t Unseen
Why do smart, hardworking founders still lose…while others win with less effort?
Founder Timing Decision System™
After that, I couldn’t unsee the pattern. I saw it everywhere — especially among founders.
Business owners launching again and again… Spending on ads. Hiring teams. Pivoting hard.
But the growth? Still stuck. Revenue flat. Burnout rising.
Then I saw something else… Another type of founder. They move once — but at the right time — and suddenly: Everything compounds. Cash flow improves. Team clicks. Momentum builds.
This is when I asked myself - Why do smart, hardworking founders still lose…while others win with less effort?
That’s when I realised something common in them - 
This isn’t a strategy problem. It’s not a marketing problem. It’s a timing problem.
And once I saw that… I couldn’t ignore it anymore.





Where It All Changed
Founder Timing Decision System™
So I started asking deeper questions…
🧠 What if there’s a way to know when to move, not just how to move?
What if there was a system that explains when growth accelerates… …and when to pause, hold cash, or restructure?
What if business owners, founders, entrepreneurs could actually have a GPS system that they never know could change the whole entire thing?
That’s when I stumbled into something I never expected: A Chinese metaphysics system called Zi Wei Dou Shu.
At first, I thought, “Isn’t this just Chinese astrology or horoscope stuff people read during New Year?”
But the more I studied it, the more I realised…
It’s not about prediction. It’s not “spiritual fluff.”
It’s about pattern recognition. It’s about how you’re built — and when you're built to thrive.
So I pulled my own chart. Not because I believed it. Just to see what it said.
And what I saw… didn’t tell me “you’ll be rich.” It showed me: – Why I burn out during certain years – Why my launches failed in specific quarters – Why certain hires clash with my leadership – And when my wealth windows actually open
It didn’t give me motivation. It gave me a map.
From that point on, I stopped guessing. I started making business decisions based on my season, my chart, my timing.
That’s when I realised: Zi Wei isn’t about your fate. It’s a Founder Decision System — disguised as metaphysics.





Where It All Changed
Founder Timing Decision System™
Over the past few years, I’ve coached founders and business owners across >10 countries, from coaches… to F&B… to real estate, property, investment… to product-based brands.
And the truth is — every business is different… but the decision patterns that cause growth — or block it — are the same.
I’ve tested this system across all kinds of models, and it always comes down to 3 things:

1️⃣ Wealth Code DNA Most business owners don’t realise this — but you’re not meant to run your business the same way someone else does. Your chart actually reveals what kind of model, income path, and strategy fits your energy and strengths.
Some are meant to build authority brands. Some thrive in fast-moving markets. Some build wealth through equity plays or licensing. When you decode this, you stop chasing every opportunity — and finally double down on your lane.
From here you’ll be able to have your A+ talent blueprint - knows who to hire 
2️⃣ Wealth Timing Cycle This is where things really shift. Because even if your strategy is perfect — if you launch in the wrong season, it’ll still backfire.
I’ve coached clients who planned big moves during Winter cycles — and after adjusting just the timing, their results 3–4X’d with less effort.
Your chart shows whether you’re in Spring (build), Summer (scale), Autumn (collect), or Winter (refine). And once you know this… You stop launching out of pressure — and start moving when momentum is actually behind you.

3️⃣ High-Performing Business Calendar Now some of you might say — “Okay, I get the big picture… but what about execution?”
That’s exactly why I created the High-Performing Business Calendar. A 90-day tactical calendar that aligns with your chart.
Instead of waking up asking “What should I do this week?” You already have a map of: – What to focus on – What to delay – What windows are opening – And what not to touch — even if it looks tempting
It’s like having your business strategy pre-aligned with your timing. You don’t guess — you follow.

These 3 pillars — your DNA, your Cycle, and your Execution Map — are the foundation of what I now call the Founder Timing Decision System™.
You’ll hear more about this soon, but I want you to know upfront: This is not just a tool I used for myself. It’s the same system I use to help clients in real industries make smarter, faster, more confident moves — without burning out or forcing growth in the wrong season.
💬 Type “FOUNDER” in the chat if you know this is something you want to build for yourself too.





Used by Celebrities & Entrepreneurs Secretly
Founder Timing Decision System™
Then also, I found something even more interesting.
Turns out, a lot of high-level people — even celebrities like Jay Chou, Andy Lau, Jack Ma and others — also use this system behind the scenes.
Not to ask “what’s going to happen to me”… but to time their next move. To decide when to scale, when to pause, and what kind of role actually fits them.
That’s when I realised — this is not superstition. It’s a high-level decision-making tool.
That hit something in me.


The Turning Point
Founder Timing Decision System™
And maybe you're thinking right now:
“Okay… but that’s you. You already have the businesses, the experience, the tools...”
I get it. It’s easy to look at where I am today and think — “Of course it worked for you.”
But here’s what most people miss:
I didn’t use Zi Wei to "maintain success." I used it when I had too many paths. Too many opportunities. Too much noise.
And no clear direction.
I used it when I had to decide:
Which project to say no to (even though it looked good on paper)
Whether to expand… or keep things lean
When to pause a launch that logically made sense — but energetically clashed with my timing
That’s what gave me clarity.
So no — it’s not about where you are right now. It’s about whether you have a system that can show you:
Where to go. When to go. And what to ignore — even when it looks tempting.
And if that system helped me navigate all of that —

Alright, so this is how top entrepreneurs are using Purple Star Astrology for real-life clarity. Spark used his Zi Wei chart to plan in business, marriage, and some big decisions — and the results speak for themselves.
But this isn’t just about him. This is about you — and what shifts when you finally see your own timing, your own path, your own blueprint.
Because when your chart shows you what season you're in… you stop chasing the wrong things. You start saying “yes” at the right time. And most importantly — you stop doubting yourself.
That’s what we’re about to unlock next


Working Harder ≠ Winning Faster
Biggest Lie of All Time:
Founder Timing Decision System™
🎤 Talking Points:

Let me show you the first lie the world told us about success… That as long as you work harder, longer, wake up earlier — you’ll succeed. That if you out-hustle everyone… you’ll eventually break through.
But the truth is — hustle alone doesn't win. Hustling in the wrong lane just gets you to the wrong place, faster.
Burnout doesn’t come from working hard.Burnout comes from running hard in a direction that was never meant for you.
Real success isn’t just about effort — it’s about direction + timing.
You don’t sprint first then look for a map. You get your coordinates. Then you move.
🧠 So pause for a moment and ask yourself: What if the reason you’re not where you want to be… isn’t a lack of discipline — it’s a lack of alignment?”
Everyone write down alignment


I Discovered The
Hard Way…
Founder Timing Decision System™
I was once in your shoes. I have discovered using the hard way
But today, things are different.
With everything we have in this modern era right now — the tools, the systems, the access we have right now...
You don’t need to go through the same struggle like 10, 20 years ago.
What took me years to figure out,
you can shortcut in days.

If You’ve Been Struggling…
This Is Probably Why…
Founder Timing Decision System™

You've Tried Everything...
Motivational videos
Meditation & Journaling
Reading billionaire habits
Following self help method
Switching careers/businesses, changing directions…

The Hard Way… (The Traditional Advice)
Founder Timing Decision System™
🟥 SECTION 3: BREAK FALSE BELIEFS
🎤 Talking Points:
Let’s be honest — If effort alone could make you rich... You’d be wealthy already.
Because you've tried everything, haven’t you?
✅ You watched motivational videos — hoping one day the right speaker will wake something up in you... ✅ You tried meditation and journaling — trying to find your purpose, your passion... ✅ You read books about billionaire routines, morning habits, millionaire mindsets... ✅ You followed what “others” said: you’re gonna do this exercise, do the ice bath, the face bath, practice gratitude & positivity ✅ Some of you even switched careers or started a business, just to feel… stuck again.
Sound familiar?
Now let me say this loud and clear — 👉 It's not your fault.
You're not lazy. You're not broken. You're just missing the one thing they never gave you:
⚠️ YOUR blueprint.
A system that’s not copied from someone else… But built around you.
And this is the part most people never hear until it’s too late:
“The system that built them — is not the system that will work for you.”
That’s why some of you feel stuck even after working so hard.
The system wasn’t wrong. It was just wrong for you.
But what if… Just what if you finally saw your system?
🧭 A path that matches your chart. 💰 A way of making money that aligns with your natural energy. 📆 And yes — the timing windows that tell you exactly when to launch, when to pivot, when to wait.
That’s what you’re going to discover in this training.
And if you're already feeling this hit deep... You're exactly where you're supposed to be today.


Destiny is not random 
it’s  programmable once decoded.

“Before we go deeper, I want to show you a clip that perfectly explains how most people sabotage their destiny — not from laziness, but from disconnection.
This is a short message from my interview with Prince EA (a youtuber with millions of subscribers) — he will show you how it hits different.”
🗣 What You Say (After Video):

Founder Timing Decision System™

SPECIAL CASE: IF NO STAR IN WEALTH PALACE,
LOOK AT THE STAR IN WELLBEING PALACE.
Laptop/ PC/ Ipad View
Some of you might realize — your Wealth Palace has no main star inside.
📌 Don’t worry. That’s totally normal in Zi Wei Dou Shu.
So, what do you do when your Wealth Palace is “empty”?
👉 Just look at the palace directly opposite it, and one to the right — That’s your Wellbeing Palace.
And for now, we’ll use the star(s) in your Wellbeing Palace to decode your wealth strategy..
You’ll still get clear insight into your money-making style and cashflow patterns.



The Wealth Palace — Your Money Magnet Blueprint
Your Wealth Palace reveals three critical factors:
✅ ① How You Naturally Attract Wealth
Example: System Builders vs Branding Magnets 
✅ ② What Business/ Models Fits You
Good Path vs Bad Path for each Wealth Type 
✅ ③ Why you’re doing everything right but still stuck?
"Today, you’ll spot your tendency 
— tomorrow, you’ll learn WHEN to move."

Founder Timing Decision System™
Your Wealth Palace Tells You More Than Just “Can I Be Rich?”
🎤 Script:
Now that you’ve located your Wealth Palace — let me show you what it actually reveals.
✅ ① How You Naturally Attract Wealth Everyone’s built differently. Some people grow rich by building systems quietly. Some grow fast by branding loud and being seen.
This is why one-size-fits-all strategies never work. Because your chart shows your unique wealth strategy.
✅ ② What Career or Business Truly Fits You When your job or business model matches your Wealth Code — you scale fast. When it doesn’t, you burn out or feel like you’re forcing everything.
That’s why today, I’ll help you see: 🔎 Which types of careers match you… and which ones may be silently blocking you.
✅ ③ Why You’re Doing Everything Right — and Still Stuck Because even if your strategy is right… if your timing is wrong, you still feel blocked.
“Today, you’ll spot your natural tendency — Tomorrow, I’ll show you when to move.”
This isn’t random. It’s not motivational. It’s coded inside your Wealth Palace.

What is Your Wealth Code?






Founder Timing Decision System™
Everyone Has a Unique Wealth Code.Yours is Written in Your Stars.
Now inside your Wealth Palace, you’ll notice a few Star Names.Maybe one, maybe more.
✅ With my Zi Wei app, you can instantly spot your Wealth Stars — no guesswork needed.
But here’s where it gets powerful:

“Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. 
Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.”

Lao Tsu
Founder Timing Decision System™
How many of you have spent your whole life… devoting your time, your energy, your emotions — to take care of your family… your spouse… your kids… even your siblings or colleagues…
But when it comes to you — there’s always “no time”?
We were taught that being a good person means putting others first. So we take responsibility for everything. Until one day… you start burning out. You don’t even feel like yourself anymore. You just want to escape.
But what if I told you — there’s a system that can flip that story?
A system that shows you the right direction in life — like finally sitting in the driver’s seat… but this time, with a GPS.
A system that shows you when to move, how to move, and how to gain back control of your life. So you don’t just survive — you thrive… with peace, alignment… and wealth.
Because like Lao Tzu once said: “Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.”
So let me ask you — how many of you want to finally step into that power?


🧠 The Strategy Planner
For those who build long-term wealth through systems, foresight, and structured power.


Founder Timing Decision System™
“Alright, let’s start with the first wealth code of the day — and this one is for the thinkers, the planners, the system builders.
These are the people who don’t randomly chase money. They want to know: What’s the structure? What’s the logic? What’s the long-term game?
They build their wealth through clarity, strategy, and control. They’re not here for quick hacks. They’re here to build something that lasts — a system, a plan, or a team that works even when they’re not there.
If you’re someone who always needs a plan before you move — or you get frustrated when things are messy, uncertain, or inefficient — this might be your wealth code.”

🧠 Strategy Planner – Ideal vs Non-Ideal Path
Founder Timing Decision System™
🎙️ Script Pointers: Strategy Planner Ideal vs Non-Ideal
SP is a very practical star, you think about long term, you love about security, you dont like changes 

Intro:
“Now let’s talk about where these Strategy Planner stars actually thrive — because these are not ‘anywhere also can’ type of people.”
“They have big-picture thinking, long-term focus, and internal systems. But if you put them in the wrong role — they either get stuck… or feel wasted.”

Examples by Star:
🔹 Zi Wei needs a leadership seat. If you put them in basic admin or retail, they’ll lose motivation fast. They shine where they can lead people, manage structure, or build elite trust.
🔹 Lian Zhen needs SOP, structure, and flow. Give them a vague, messy startup with no system — they’ll go crazy. But give them HR, ops, backend, or online teams — they shine.
🔹 Tian Ji needs a place to think. If the job is all action, no thinking — they’ll get bored or disconnected. They make money with ideas, structure, creative flow — not just effort.
🔹 Tian Liang is all about long-term career. You give them fast money scams or pushy sales, they’ll run. But if they feel like they’re helping people long-term — they’ll stay loyal and grow big.

🧭 Transition to Investment Brain (大财型财富代码)
Transition Script:
“Now not everyone makes money through big systems or strategy.”
“Some people? They just want things that are solid, proven, and profitable. They don’t need to talk so much. They just want to know: ‘How much is the return? What’s the risk?’”
“These are the ones with the Investment Brain. They grow wealth through discipline, cashflow control, and smart asset moves.”
“Let’s step into the next wealth code: The ones who may look slow… but they’re stacking money quietly while others burn out.”


Founder Timing Decision System™
From burnout and hustle 
→ to 7-figure 
businesses 
on autopilot
(Jason’s chart)
Revised Spoken Flow (Strategy Planner story)
1. Before (Wu Qu context): “I had a student with strong Wu Qu energy — Wu Qu is the star of creation. He loved to start things, always driven, always wanting to open something new. But that same energy made him impatient. He jumped into too many things at once, and very quickly he was in firefighting mode. Every day was busy, but progress felt stuck.”
2. Transition (broad + relatable): “And here’s the truth: a lot of people think hard work alone equals success. But have you noticed? Some people work tirelessly, yet results stay flat. Others seem to work less, but their moves create bigger outcomes. Why? Because success isn’t just about effort — it’s about strategy. Working hard without a clear plan often leads to burnout, not breakthroughs. And this applies whether you’re running a business or working a career — without strategy, effort doesn’t compound.”
3. Turning Point (Zi Wei insight): “When I read his chart, I saw he also had Lian Zhen in his Wealth Palace. That completely shifted things. Lian Zhen means his true Wealth Machine comes from systems and planning — SOPs, structures, strategy. So in our 1-on-1, I guided him on exactly how to do this: how to streamline his work, how to build processes, even how to put the right team around him so he could stop firefighting.”
4. After (transformation): “And the results were massive. Today, instead of running in circles, he runs 10+ ventures on systems, and his investments bring in 7 figures a month. But more importantly, he’s no longer burnt out. He finally has clarity, direction, and sustainable growth.”
5. Chat Engagement (universal): “Who here feels like this? You put in so much effort, but without a clear plan, it just drains you. Type PLAN in the chat if you know it’s time to move with strategy, not just effort.”



💰 The Investment Brain
For those who win by logic, long-term planning, and capital efficiency.
“You don’t do the work — you make your money do the work.”


🗣️ Script Pointers:
“Now, let’s move into the second wealth code — the investment brain
“These stars don’t like guessing. They want to see the numbers— before they move.”
 and this one might look similar to Strategy Planner at first…
But here’s the key difference:
👉 Strategy Planners lead with the head — they love planning, managing, building systems.
👉 Investment Brain types lead with financial instinct. They don’t always need to plan 10 steps ahead — but they’re very sharp when it comes to money flow, stability, and timing.
These are the people who don’t overthink — they just ask: ‘Got profit or not?’ ‘Can hold long-term or not?’
They grow wealth through assets, savings, careful decisions, and consistent action. They may move slower — but every move is measured.
They don’t need to manage big teams or build complicated systems. Sometimes, just controlling their cashflow, holding good assets, and being consistent… is already enough to win.”
“If this is your wealth code — don’t let fast-talkers distract you. Stick to your cashflow, and let your numbers win.”

—------------------
They have something not everyone has — a kind of money instinct.
They know when something's worth it, and when to walk away.
You make money in businesses where you control the cashflow, the structure, or the budget — even if someone else is doing the actual delivery. Think like this: You’re running a logistics company. You don’t drive the truck — but you track every delivery and cost to the cent. Or you're a CFO. Nobody sees you — but you quietly save the company millions by knowing how to manage funds.

💼 As an Employee: You thrive in jobs that need structure, detail, and control — like accounting, auditing, finance, or backend ops. The more complex the money flow, the more you shine. You're the person who knows where money leaks before anyone else notices.
👉 If you have someone in your company who’s super particular about numbers, always spots mistakes before the boss even notices — that person probably has Wu Qu energy. Type “Team Wu Qu” in chat if you have someone like this on your team.

👑 As a Boss: You build businesses with strong systems. You might not be “frontline,” but you make sure everything runs like a machine — finance ops, loan services, trading biz, or anything with structured profit flow.
You’re the type who doesn’t waste time — just show the P&L, show the breakeven, and get to work.
👉 If your boss or manager is the type who always asks: “Got numbers? Show me the cost breakdown.” Chances are, they’ve got Wu Qu traits. Type “Wu Qu Boss” in chat if that sounds like your leader.

🧠 Quote to end: “You don’t need the spotlight to win. You just need to control the cashflow.”
👉 And if you have Wu Qu in your Wealth Palace, type “Wu Qu” in chat now. You’ve got the cash control code.




🏛️ Tian Fu（天府）—— The Builder
Business Path:Assets + Stability — property, logistics, and long-term careers.Runs real estate team, logistics biz, or structured MLM business.


Founder Timing Decision System™
Tianfu is quite conservative 

Tian Fu people are solid. They love stability, order, and building something that lasts. That's why we also call them “the builder”.  You won’t find them chasing fast money or overnight success — they believe in slow and steady wealth.
They’re the type who quietly stack assets — one property, one plan, one system at a time. They don’t show off, but 10 years later, their foundation is stronger than anyone else’s.
You make money through asset-based industries — like property, logistics, government jobs, or structured plans. If there's a clear flow, a system to follow, and a way to slowly build — that’s where you win.

💼 As an Employee: You do well in stable, process-driven work — civil service, property sales, logistics, or admin-based roles. You’re not into big risks. You prefer clear SOPs, fixed income, and long-term stability.
👉 Got someone in your team who’s been in the same company for 8 years — and has no intention to leave? That’s probably Tian Fu.
They always say things like: 💬 “Aiyah… slow slow come lah.” 💬 “I just want something stable.” 💬 “As long got EPF, bonus, and no politics — I happy already.”
Type “Tian Fu Teammate” if you know someone like this.

👑 As a Boss: You build long-term, asset-focused businesses — like property teams, logistics companies, or structured MLM networks. You care more about systems that run long-term than hype that disappears fast.
👉 If your boss always says: 💬 “We plan for 5 years, not 5 days.” 💬 “Follow the system. Trust the process.” 💬 “I want something that can still run even when I’m not around.”
That’s textbook Tian Fu.
Type “Tian Fu Boss” in chat if you’ve worked with someone like this.

🧠 Quote to end: “Others chase hype. You build foundations.”
👉 And if you have Tian Fu in your Wealth Palace, type “Tian Fu” in chat now. You’re here to grow long-term assets — not gamble.”




🌙 Tai Yin（太阴）—— The Nurturer
Business Path:Emotion + Cashflow Driven — beauty, wellness, property 
Builds soft-power biz — beauty, retreats, rental property, women-led brands



Founder Timing Decision System™
Tai Yin people have soft power. They’re gentle, caring, and naturally attract others — especially in the female market.
They don’t chase money through force. They attract it through emotion, taste, and connection.
You’ll never see a Tai Yin person doing aggressive sales. But they’ll quietly build a loyal group of repeat customers — from a skincare line, to a coaching program, to a boutique travel biz.
You make money through industries tied to beauty, wellness, care, femininity… and even real estate. Yes — property and long-term rental income are also very Tai Yin — as long as there’s emotional touch and relationship-based service.
Don’t get stuck thinking it's just beauty jobs — as long as you can sell with emotion + softness, you’re already using your Tai Yin power.
Even a branding coach, wedding planner, real estate agent, or Airbnb host can be very Tai Yin — if your offer makes people feel something.

💼 As an Employee: You shine in roles that serve women — makeup, skincare, salon, wellness, boutique travel, or even property sales. You don’t like loud, fast-paced chaos. You prefer calm environments where you can build trust.
👉 If you know someone in your team who’s soft-spoken, but always gets client compliments — or has that “everyone likes to talk to her” kind of vibe — that’s Tai Yin.
You’ll often hear her say: 💬 “Customer not happy? Let me talk to her.” 💬 “Let’s give her a little freebie, she’ll feel appreciated.” 💬 “Don’t hard-sell la... must slowly build feeling first.”
Type “Tai Yin Teammate” if you have someone like this around you.

👑 As a Boss: You build loyalty-based businesses — salons, retreats, beauty brands, rental properties, or women-led communities. You lead with care, not pressure. People follow you because they feel seen, safe, and supported.
👉 If your boss or upline always says things like: 💬 “Let them feel heard first — we close later.” 💬 “Don’t rush, connection first.” 💬 “We’re not here to sell — we’re here to serve.”
Or if her team stays with her for years — not because of money, but because she treats everyone like family… That’s Tai Yin energy.
Type “Tai Yin Boss” if that sounds familiar.

🧠 Quote to end: “You don’t need to fight for attention — just make people feel safe, and they’ll follow.”
👉 And if you have Tai Yin in your Wealth Palace, type “Tai Yin” in chat now — you’ve got the soft power to turn care, connection, and even property… into cash.

💰 Investment Brain – Ideal vs Non-Ideal Path
Founder Timing Decision System™
🗣️ Intro: “Now let’s zoom into the Investment Brain stars — these are the ones who are money-minded, risk-aware, and love stability. But even with all that potential — wrong job, wrong model — and they burn out fast.”
🔁 Flow Cue:
“Notice how all three stars — Wu Qu, Tian Fu, Tai Yin — need clarity, structure, or emotional connection in their money path. They either work directly with money… or with people who trust them with it.”
But here’s what most people don’t realize:
👉 Just because you have one of these stars in your Wealth Palace doesn’t mean you’ll automatically get rich.
Plus if your current 10-year cycle is activating an obstacle — especially a 忌星, a clashing palace, or negative dynamic — you won’t just feel blocked.
You’ll feel like your whole system is collapsing.
👉 You could be in the “right job”… and still lose everything. Why? Because when powerful wealth stars activate in the wrong timing, the damage is bigger.
This is what people don’t realize:
💥 The more powerful the wealth star, the more destructive it becomes if misfired.
You’ll see things like:
Sudden losses
Business collapse
Employees steal money
Team betrayals
Unexpected lawsuits
Family wealth wiped out
Cashflow stuck no matter how hard you try
And you’ll keep thinking “why so unlucky?” But the truth is — it’s not random.
It's because something in your chart has been triggered. You’re not just losing money — you’re triggering a chain reaction.
👉 That’s why it’s not just about knowing your wealth star. You need to ask:
What is causing the leak?
Who is the one influencing your downfall?
What will this loss lead to next?
All of this can only be seen in a proper 1-on-1 reading.Otherwise, you’re flying blind — and paying the price with your money, time, and health.

🔥 Transition Script:
“But not everyone builds wealth through systems or slow growth. Some people? They attract it. Through attention. Style. Vibe.”
“They walk into a room and people already want to know: ‘Who’s that?’ These are our Branding Magnet stars.”
“Next — let me show you the ones who don’t chase money… they pull money in just by showing up right.”

From boring 9-to-5 job
→ to 4–5 figure monthly 
investment income
Final Polished Version (Investment Brain story)
1. Before (set the scene): “I had a student — a strong career woman. She was an assistant director in a banking company, almost C-level. She had been working there for nearly 20 years. On paper, not bad pay… but in reality, every day was the same 9-to-5 routine. Same job scope, same tasks. It felt boring, stuck. Sometimes she had to deal with office politics — being sandwiched between directors above and a team below that didn’t always listen. So before our 1-on-1, she kept asking herself: What else can I do? How can I use my free time to grow, to earn more? The problem was, she wasn’t sure if there was really an opportunity for her.”
2. Transition (clear reality check): “And I know many of you can relate to this. You might already have a stable career, good title, good income… but inside, you wonder: Can I actually build something beyond my job? Or is it too late? The truth is, your career pays the bills, but it doesn’t always build long-term wealth. And that’s where the 1-on-1 makes all the difference.”
3. Turning Point (Zi Wei insight): “When I read her chart, I saw she had two very strong stars sitting in her Wealth Palace — Wu Qu and Tian Fu. That combination is powerful. It shows she’s perfect for wealth that comes through long-term, steady growth — especially through investments. Her chart wasn’t telling her to quit her career. It was telling her to leverage her discipline and structure to compound wealth outside her 9-to-5.”
4. After (transformation): “So she decided to act on it. She used her free time to study investments, track market trends, and even found a mentor to guide her. And the result? Today, every month she consistently generates four to five figures in investment income. She didn’t have to give up her career. She simply unlocked the potential her chart already showed.”
5. Chat Engagement (relevant to everyone): “Who here feels the same? You already have a stable job, but you want to see how to grow beyond your salary. Type INVEST in the chat if you know it’s time to put your money to work, not just your hours.”

They’re the type who can convince you without shouting, without hype — just by explaining things step by step, calmly and clearly.

You make money by using your words — webinars, coaching, sales, education, anything that needs clear explanation or script.
For ju men, you don’t just talk whatever you want, you need to talk with frameworks, if not you’ll be perceived as someone who’s very unlocgical
Thats why you always complain why your husband, your kids don’;t listen to you

Founder Timing Decision System™
Po Jun people also act fast — but unlike Qi Sha who aims to solve or strike, Po Jun’s goal is to break things down… and rebuild it even better.
They’re the rebels. They don’t follow perfect systems — they challenge it, test it, destroy what’s outdated, and start over. Sometimes their path begins with chaos — but that chaos becomes their raw material.
They love hands-on, real-world work — especially in jobs that start messy, but end with solid results.
You make money in 拆+建 industries — renovation, logistics, warehouse, delivery, or anything involving movement, structure, and rebuilding.

💥 Branding Magnet – Ideal vs Non-Ideal Path
Founder Timing Decision System™
🗣️ Intro: “Now let’s talk about where these branding-driven stars actually shine — because trust me, wrong industry, wrong crowd — their fire will shut down fast.”
🔁 Flow Cue:
“So the pattern is clear: Branding Magnet stars thrive in fast, visible, high-impact roles.
Don’t ask them to hide in the corner — they need to be out there, using what makes them unforgettable.”

But here’s the truth:
👉 Just because you have one of these stars in your Wealth Palace does not mean you’ll automatically become the “popular one”, the leader, or the face of a brand.
Because in Zi Wei Dou Shu, it’s not just about what star you have — it’s also about what star is being activated, and when.
If your chart is activating a 忌星 or clash now, you’re not born to shine — you’re born to be attacked. Misunderstood. Dragged down.
You’re not getting famous — you’re getting cancelled, sued, or drowning in debt from the wrong exposure.
💥 The more powerful the star, the bigger the damage when the timing is wrong.
And no one sees it coming — until it’s too late.
So don’t assume you’re in your “shining season” just because you have the right star. You need to check:
What’s being activated now?
Who’s sabotaging you in secret?
What’s the next domino that will fall?
👉 All of that only shows up in a 1-on-1 chart reading.
Because being “born to shine” means nothing… if your chart is currently blocking your light.
“OK Let’s move into our final wealth code — and trust me, this one is so underrated, And when their timing is activated correctly… they become the reason why other people succeed.”

From posting for free → to a 6-figure 
branding machine
Final Polished Version (spark’s chart)
1. Before (set the scene): “I had a student who was a finance investor and also a business owner. Before he came to me, he was already trying to build his personal brand — just like a typical content creator. Writing scripts, shooting videos, posting content, slowly growing his followers. By the time we met, he already had 10,000 followers. On the surface, the numbers looked good — but inside, he felt something was wrong. Because even with more visibility, the money wasn’t following as expected.”
2. Transition (clear reality check): “Now, a lot of people assume — if someone has many followers, surely they must be making a lot of money, right? But the truth is, that’s not always the case. You can look at influencers today — some have huge followings, but not all of them are earning well. Why? Because visibility and monetization are two completely different things. Being seen doesn’t automatically mean being paid.”
3. Turning Point (Zi Wei insight): “When I read his chart, I told him: your true Wealth Machine is the Branding Magnet. That means you already have the potential for branding — you’re naturally good at talking, at being visible. But it’s not enough to just get attention. The real key is: you must turn that attention into income.”
4. After (transformation): “So I guided him to step into speaking, launch funnels, package his own courses, and position his brand properly. And he told me afterwards — this was one of the best calls he’s ever had. He said it was even more practical than working with business consultants. Because in our 1-on-1, I don’t just show you your potential — I also share my proven frameworks that I’ve applied across different businesses. And the result? His content stopped being just ‘for show.’ Every word he spoke carried weight — and brought in revenue. He shifted from posting for free… to building a brand that pays.”
5. Chat Engagement (relevant to everyone): “Let me ask you — how many of you feel this way? Either you already have some visibility, but struggle to convert it into money… OR you wish you could be more visible in the first place, so people actually know who you are. Type BRAND in the chat if you know the real goal is not just to be seen, but to be seen and paid.”

🤝 Collaborator – Ideal VS Non-Ideal Path
Founder Timing Decision System™
Just because you have these stars, doesn’t mean every “nice-sounding” job will work for you.
👉 If the timing is wrong, or you’re activating a 忌 star, you’ll still feel drained, unappreciated — or even betrayed by the very people you’re helping.
Some of you might feel like: “I give so much… why nothing’s working?”
That’s not a mindset issue. It’s your chart activation + timing cycle clashing with your true wealth path.
💡 Want to know who's draining you, what season you're in, and how to realign it all? That’s what we uncover inside the 1-on-1 consultation.


Founder Timing Decision System™
From solo hustle 
→ to 10+ multi-industry partnerships
Spoken Flow (Collaborator story)
1. Before (set the scene): “I had a student in his early 30s, already a very successful businessman. By that age, he had already been involved in multiple businesses — not just one, but several different ventures. And people often asked: how can someone so young manage so many things at once?”
2. Transition (clear reality check): “The truth is, not everyone succeeds by doing everything alone. Some people are born creators, some are strategists, but there are also people who thrive by working with others. Because real wealth doesn’t always come from being the smartest person in the room — it comes from knowing how to combine talents and create win-win deals.”
3. Turning Point (Zi Wei insight): “When I read his chart, I saw he carried the Collaborator Wealth Code. That means his real gift is in people — knowing how to spot someone’s talent, seeing their potential, and matching it with the right opportunity. He’s not just doing business… he’s building partnerships that multiply value for everyone involved.”
4. After (transformation): “And that’s exactly how he grew so fast. Instead of trying to run everything on his own, he leveraged collaboration. He partnered with people who had strengths he didn’t have. He structured deals where both sides could win. That’s why by his early 30s, he had already touched multiple industries, and every project he was in gained momentum quickly — because it wasn’t just him, it was the power of partnerships.”
5. Chat Engagement (relevant to everyone): “Who here feels like this too? You know your strength is not in doing everything yourself, but in working with people, spotting opportunities, and creating win-win deals. Type TEAM in the chat if this resonates with you.”




Which Wealth Type Feels Most Like You?
Founder Timing Decision System™
So now you’ve seen the 4 core wealth codes:
🔹 Strategy Planner — for those who build systems, think long-term, and lead through structure.
🔹 Investment Brain — for those with money instincts, asset focus, and steady, cashflow-driven growth.
🔹 Branding Magnet — for those who shine, lead, and earn through visibility, energy, and attraction.
🔹 Collaborator — for those who win through loyalty, service, support, and connection.
So now you’ve seen all 4 wealth codes. Some of you are big-picture thinkers. Some of you are better with money than people. Some of you shine naturally. Some of you support others and win from the background.
But no matter which one you relate to — there’s one thing you need to understand next.
—--------------------------------------------------------------

But here’s the one truth I need you to remember:
🧨 Just because you have a star — doesn’t mean it’s activated.
💥 Just because you’re born to shine… doesn’t mean you’ll shine now.
💥 Just because you’re wired for money… doesn’t mean the money is flowing this cycle.
Some of you might already be in the wrong field. Some might be activating a 忌星 that’s quietly draining your efforts. Some might be right on the edge of your wealth breakthrough — but you won’t see it without a full chart read.

🧭 That’s why we offer the 1-on-1 Destiny Wealth Blueprint Consultation.
This isn’t just about “what star you have” — It’s about what’s happening in your chart right now, what timing is opening, and what specific action will shift your wealth path forward.
Because being “meant for success” means nothing… if you don’t know when to move, what to change, and how to unlock it.
👉 Book your 1-on-1 consult. Let’s decode your wealth path, your blockages, and your timing — together.
Your wealth code is real. But it’s your move that makes it work.


Should I Start a Business or 
Side Hustle?

Founder Timing Decision System™
One of the most common questions I get is: “Am I suitable for business or side hustle?”
Here’s the truth: If your Career Palace or Wealth Palace has Power stars, it doesn’t mean you’ll succeed — it just means you’ll have the urge to try.
There’s a difference between: Wanting to be a boss… and actually becoming a successful one.
Some people are born to hustle. They hate following orders. They want freedom. But they never look at the risk.
They only see the potential — not the timing. And when they start during a bad cycle? Boom — failed partnership, debt, team problems. And they say: “I guess I’m not meant for business.” No. You just didn’t check your chart.
If you have strong wealth stars, you actually need to be even more strategic. Because the gains are big — but so are the risks.


有几个现象事业宫或财帛宫化权不代表你一定会当老板，但是你一定会想要当老板，那是两回事
想要 跟 有 》这两个是两个概念
我想要当老板，我很想要有自己的事业，我想要创业，小创业，大创业也好
但是不代表你一定会成功
创业归创业，成功归成功，两个概念
他的人格特质会想要创业，那你要创业的话，更加要知道你会不会成功啊
如果你没有请教过老师，失败几率是非常高的，背负几率是相当高的
你有好的财星在的话，一定要更加懂你的未来运势
否则，创业一定是他想要的，但利益跟风险·它是相当存在的
你创业的时候一定是看到利益，一般人不会特地去想到风险
当你运不好的时候，你不但没有拿到利益，你还冲进了风险
成败在运，不在你的先天人格特质


What If My Wealth or Career Palace 
Is Empty?

Founder Timing Decision System™
Another common one — “What if my Wealth Palace or Career Palace is empty?”
Let me tell you — Empty is still better than having a negative activation.
Having an empty palace doesn’t mean you can’t make money. It just means your energy isn’t “anchored” there. So it’s harder to hold money or feel stable long-term.
But with the right activation — even empty palaces can become money-makers. It’s not about what’s missing. It’s about what’s moving in and out of that space during your current cycle.
In ziwei we got different timeframe - your current year cycle, 10 year cycle - good cycle or bad cycle - it all comes down to your RIGHT timing

What If I Have More Than One Star 
in a Palace?

Founder Timing Decision System™
Some of you open your chart and panic — “There’s 3 stars in my Wealth Palace! Which one do I follow?”
Good news — if you have more than one star, you’ve got more tools to work with, more opportunities to work with.  It usually means you’re someone who doesn’t just make money in one way.
You’re the type who can juggle a career + freelance. Or build income from multiple talents. It’s not a conflict — it’s flexibility. Write down flexible 
But again… the question isn’t “what star do I have?” It’s “which one is being activated right now?” That’s what we figure out in your 1-on-1 consultation.

Why Is My Kid So Smart But Still Can’t 
Perform?
Founder Timing Decision System™
You might look at your child and say: “He’s smart. He understands fast. But why are his grades still terrible?”
Here’s why: It’s not always about intelligence. Sometimes the current 10-year cycle or annual cycle is activating a “忌 star” — and that messes with focus, mood, and outcome.
So yes — your kid might be gifted. But if they’re in a low cycle, nothing sticks.
Timing doesn’t just apply to business or money. It applies to every part of life ranged from small decisions to big decisions you made in your career, work, family, spouse, children and etc

Ask Yourself This
Why do you wanna be able to lead, grow & invest with clarity today?
How do you plan to get there?
When do you want it to happen?

Founder Timing Decision System™



Founder Timing Decision System™
“Now, let’s pause for a moment. You’ve just seen your Money DNA — how your chart shows the way you’re wired to create wealth.
But here’s the truth: at this point, you’ve got two roads ahead of you.
👉 On the left — you can take what you learned tonight, go home, and try to figure out the rest by yourself. And yes, you might get there… but it’s slow, risky, and most people end up second-guessing for years.
👉 On the right — you can fast-track. Like express pass You can get guidance, clarity, and the exact steps mapped out for you. No guessing. No wasting time. Straight into action.
So the question is: which road do you want to take?
Because if you want the fast-track… that’s why I created the VIP option


Founder Timing Decision System™
The truth is, most people forget about 80% of what they hear within just a few days.
And I don’t want that to happen to you. That’s why we created the VIP Fast-Track option — so you don’t just leave here inspired, but you actually have the tools to make it stick.
With VIP, you’re going to get:
The Launch-Hire-Invest Shortcut SheetYou’ll get access to the exact way real business decisions, like launching, hiring, or investing are analyzed using Purple Star Astrology logic. Just real-world application.
The Profit Leak AuditEach person has a way they unconsciously leak profit, burn momentum, or repeat the same expensive patterns.This audit helps you catch the blind spots before they cost you.
Exclusive Training NotesMaximize your event experience with a complete set of event notes and actionable steps, delivered straight to your inbox. With these detailed notes and the full slide deck at your fingertips, you’ll know exactly what to focus on and can revisit the insights and strategies anytime, at your convenience.
Zi Wei Strategy: How Million-Dollar Decisions Are MadeThis pre-training walks you through how real business owners build and scale wealth using Purple Star logic, from accumulation to protection to long-term moves.

Now here’s the best part — our team has already posted the VIP link in the chat.Normally, we charge [$797] for this, but since you’re already here live, you can add VIP for just [$37 bucks]. That’s less than your dinner out tonight. You can also scan the QR code on the top right of this screen, (INVEST)
But — this is only open tonight. Once today ends, the offer disappears, and you won’t see it again.

Found your natural lane
Dropped wrong paths
Flipped weakness into gift
Committed to 1 step
Founder Timing Decision System™
Let’s lock in what you uncovered today — as a founder.
👉 First — you identified your core role in the business. Some of you aren’t meant to be in execution. Some of you shouldn’t be chasing every opportunity. Some of you operate best in strategy, capital decisions, partnerships, or scaling systems.
How many of you saw this and thought: “No wonder things felt heavy — I was operating outside my real role.” (Type ME.)

👉 Second — you saw which paths were costing you time and money. It’s not that those paths are “bad”. They’re just not aligned with how you create results.
Many founders don’t fail because the idea is wrong — they fail because they’re personally mispositioned in the business.
How many of you felt relief when you realised what to stop doing? (Type ME.)

👉 Third — you reframed what you thought was a weakness. Being cautious became risk control. Being slow became decision quality. Being bold became growth leverage.
When the role is right, what used to feel like a limitation becomes an advantage.
Who here saw their decision style differently tonight? (Type ME.)

👉 And last — you committed to one aligned move. Not more hustle. Not more tactics.
One clear action that fits your role, your path, and your decision style.
Because businesses don’t scale from doing more things — they scale when the right person pulls the right lever consistently.


Wealth = Vehicle × Timing
Founder Timing Decision System™
Now, here’s the truth.
Finding your lane is only half the story.
Think about it — a Ferrari in the wrong lane burns fuel. A Ferrari at the wrong light? It crashes.
Right vehicle, wrong timing = disaster.
That’s why tomorrow is critical. I’m going to show you your Golden 10-Year Cycle — the roadmap that tells you when to accelerate, when to hold back, and when to defend.
If today was about the what… tomorrow is about the when.
Who here wants to know your timing windows — your money seasons, the exact decade where everything changes? (Type TIMING in the chat.)
You don’t want to miss Day-2. Because once you know your timing… you’ll never look at decisions the same way again


If I built your full Timing Decision System with you step-by-step…

Would that be helpful?
Founder Timing Decision System™
Before we close tonight, let me ask you something.
If I could sit with you, and map your entire Timing decision system— not just one palace, not just one code, but all 12 palaces, all the activations, all the cycles — step by step, clearly, so you know exactly what to do next…
Would that help you?
Type YES in the chat if you know that would change everything.
[pause, let chat flood — call out names, build energy]
I see the YES’s flying in… Beautiful. That’s exactly why we’re here together.
But first — before we build your full Wealth Blueprint, tomorrow you need to see your timing. That’s the missing piece. So make sure you’re back for Day-2.”


Worksheet of Day-1

Same time, same place tomorrow. Don’t miss it.
👉 And before you go, remember to scan the QR code and complete your Wealth DNA board tonight. It only takes 5 minutes, and it will make tomorrow ten times more powerful for you. And if you wanna join the VIP fast lane, im sure you’re going to need it too…

”And for everyone else staying until the end tonight — I’ve got a surprise bonus for you, so stay sharp. Then we gonna have a Q&A session dedicated for you at the end as well.


“Now, I want to take you back to how we ended last night. Remember that jellybean video? Each bean representing one day of your life… and by the end, you realise how little time you actually have left for the things that truly matter.
And this is exactly why I created this system. Not just to show you charts or stars… but to make sure you don’t waste the time you do have.
I’ll give you an example. One of my students, Jason — super smart guy, hardworking, but he kept getting stuck. He jumped into 10 different businesses in five years, always working like crazy, but nothing works. When we looked at his chart, his timing was completely off — he was going all in during his “setup” years instead of his “harvest” years. Once he shifted his moves to match his right timing, his income tripled in 4 months… without working more hours.
That’s the difference timing makes.
In my other businesses, I’ve also built multiple million-dollar company — not by hustling harder, but by making the right moves at the right time.
And that’s exactly what we’re diving into today — your timing. So that every jellybean you’ve got left is spent on the right path, with the right people, doing the right things.
If you’re ready to stop guessing, and start using timing as your unfair advantage… let’s jump into Day 2.”

MASTER YOUR GOLDEN TIMING CYCLE
DAY 2
So today, we’re gonna show you how to master your golden cycle, 

Timing isn’t a luxury 
It’s survival 
Founder Timing Decision System™
Let’s be honest…
Most founders don’t fail because they’re lazy. They fail because they launch at the wrong time. They hire too fast. They invest too early. Or worse — they double down during a down cycle.
And I get it.
Who doesn’t want success? Who doesn’t want to scale, grow, build an empire, create legacy? You know you want that. You just don’t know when to move — and how to time it right.
But here’s the dangerous part…
If you’re still thinking:
“I’ll check my chart when I have more time…” “Let me just survive this quarter first…” “I think what I’m doing is okay already — no need to overthink…”
These thoughts? That false sense of control?
💀 That’s what will silently kill 90% of business owners in 2026.
Not the economy. Not competition. But no urgency.
No urgency = your business stalls. Your momentum dies. Your cash flow dries. Your team burns out.
💥 The capital’s gone. 💥 The campaign didn’t land. 💥 The team’s disengaged. And you're left wondering: “Where did I go wrong? I did everything I could…”
Here’s where.
You treated timing like a luxury. When it’s actually your first line of defence.
That’s why I say this clearly: 👉 Timing is not a luxury. It’s survival.
And to prove that to you — Let me show you someone who mastered this before the rest of the world even knew what was happening.
The man behind Tesla. PayPal. SpaceX.
Elon Musk.
Most people think his success came from genius or obsession. But the deeper truth is: His biggest wins didn’t come from ideas. They came from perfect timing.
Let’s break it down — season by season.



Founder Timing Decision System™
🧠 Elon Musk: Founder Timing Cycle

Let’s talk about someone you definitely know — Elon Musk.
When people think of Elon, they think Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, billions.
But what they don’t aware about… is timing.
The truth is — Elon didn’t win just because he’s smart. He won because he made his biggest moves in alignment with timing.

🧠 Teaching Point:
Here’s what I want you to realise:
Every founder has cycles. And when you understand which one you’re in — you stop guessing.
You stop launching in Winter and wondering why no one’s buying.
You stop trying to scale in Spring and wondering why everything’s not sticking.

This was 1996. Elon built software to help newspapers go digital — with maps, directories, all that. Smart idea, right?
But here’s the thing… the market wasn’t ready. It was still early internet. Newspapers were slow. People didn’t fully get it.
So what happened?
He exited with $22 million. Not bad at all — but compared to what came later… it’s small.
That was his Spring Season — The phase where you’re testing, building, planting seeds. You’re supposed to explore — not force scale.
And if you launch too early… even a good idea won’t hit max impact.

🔴 Phase 2 — PayPal: His Summer Season
Then came PayPal.
This time, the market was READY. People were shopping online. E-commerce was growing. Everyone needed fast, secure payments.
And Elon? He moved fast.
He caught his Summer Season perfectly — High momentum. High response. The world wanted what he had.
In 2002, he exited with $165 million.
Same brain. Same work ethic. But 7X the result — because of timing.

🟤 Phase 3 — Tesla: Autumn Season
Now let’s fast forward again — 2008. Elon becomes CEO of Tesla.
This wasn’t an overnight win. He had to wait for battery tech, public sentiment, regulations.
But once the timing aligned — boom. Tesla became the name in electric cars.
That’s Autumn Season. You scale what you planted. You go big — but it’s all strategic.
Tesla was his harvest window.

⚫ Phase 4 — Twitter: Winter Season?
And now… we’ve got Twitter.
Massive acquisition. Big audience. Big splash.
But also… massive resistance. Confusion. Rebranding chaos.
Could this be his Winter Season?
You see — even if you're Elon Musk, if you push during Winter… You’re going to meet resistance.
Sometimes the smartest move is to reset, refine, hold.
🧩 Close & Offer Seed (Soft):
Look — Elon didn’t just win because he’s a genius. He won because he knew when to move.
And if you want to grow in 2026 — you can’t afford to guess anymore.
You need to know your Founder Timing Cycle.
And that’s what I give my clients inside the Founder Timing Decision System™.
It shows you:
Which season you’re in
Which move to make — launch, scale, pause, hire, invest
What NOT to do so you don’t waste 6 months on the wrong plan
Because when you time it right — even one move… Can 10X your results.
💬 Type “RIGHT MOVE” in the chat if you felt this.



What business models fits you?
Are you scaling in the wrong season?
Are you still hiring based on instinct?
What should you focus on the next 90 days?
Is there a smarter way to add different income streams?
What offer is built to win? 
Founder Timing Decision System™
“What we’re about to talk about today… is extremely powerful. It’s about your Wealth Path — something that, once you see it, could completely shift how you move in 2026 and beyond.
Now, let me ask you this…Who here has ever worked really hard in your business —  AND still wonder why the growth doesn’t match the effort, the spend, or the sacrifice?You followed what “should” work…
You invested time, energy, team, ads, systems…
But the results? Not matching the effort.

Type ‘YES’ in the chat if that sounds familiar.

You see, you’re not alone. And it’s not because you’re not capable or that you didn’t try hard enough… It’s simply because you’ve been playing in the wrong lane.
So today, as we begin Day 1 of this bootcamp — we’re going to help founders and business owners like you to finally discover your Wealth DNA using a high precision system called ziweidoushu — the lane that’s truly meant for you.”


Founder Timing Decision System™
Before we jump into tonight’s session, I want to show you something that happened right after yesterday’s class.
Within just a few hours, my inbox was flooded with messages from business owners — just like you.
One said:
“Cae, for the first time… I know which lane I should be in. I stopped second-guessing my next move.”
Another told me:
“I actually slept early last night — because I finally saw where to focus next quarter.”
And one message hit me hard:
“All this time, I thought I was failing… But it turns out, I was just in the wrong vehicle — at the wrong time.”
Now why am I showing you this?
Because it proves something powerful: When you get clarity, momentum can return instantly.
Not next year. Not when the market is better. Instantly.
✅ One small shift — and the stress drops. ✅ Your head clears. ✅ The team stops firefighting. ✅ And most importantly — your business regains direction.
And here’s why this matters for you as a founder:
If just understanding your Wealth Code DNA yesterday could already give you relief, focus, and peace…
Then imagine what happens when you also understand your timing.
Not just what you’re meant to build… But when to launch. When to scale. When to pause. When to defend. And when to go all in.
That’s what we’re doing tonight.
Because let me tell you — Clarity is not the end.
👉 It’s the beginning.
Tonight, we’re layering Timing on top of your Founder DNA. This is where your moves become predictive. Where you stop playing reactive chess — and start seeing 5 steps ahead.
That’s when you stop wasting years on the wrong model. That’s when you stop hiring people who drain you. That’s when you stop launching when the market isn't listening.
And instead — you start compounding returns, In the right season, With the right moves, Backed by a decision system you trust.
Let’s begin.



Have you tried scaling your business… but ended burning more money while profit shrinks?
Have you hustled for years… but your competitors succeed faster with less effort?
Have you hired more people… but   somehow makes you even busier?

Founder Timing Decision System™
Let’s be honest — how many of you have experienced this?
You tried to scale… but profit shrinks, ads burn, and the team drains more than they drive.
You’ve been hustling for years… yet someone with half your skills gets results 10x faster.
You thought hiring would free you up — but now you’re even deeper in operations, managing more chaos than before.
If any of that sounds familiar, you’re not alone. And there’s a reason for it — which we’re going to decode tonight.


WHY I’M OBSESSED WITH TIMING
Founder Timing Decision System™
People always ask me — “Cae, why are you so obsessed with timing?”
Why do I talk about it like it’s the secret behind everything — wealth, happiness, success?
Because I learned it the hard way.
You can work hard, you can do everything right…
But if the timing is wrong, life still says no.
And I learned that truth from fear — not from success.

I thought hiring more 
would free me, but it only buried me deeper.
Founder Timing Decision System™
🗣 Full Script:
Let me tell you something I’ve never shared on a public stage before.
I used to think that once you reached a certain level — big team, solid revenue, media coverage — things would finally get easier.
But I was wrong.
Years ago, I was leading a team of 30… then 50… then 100. Across departments. Across time zones. Agency, product, tech, ops — all under one roof.
From the outside, it looked like I had it all under control.
But inside?
Every month… I was bleeding.
💸 My cost spiked into 6… sometimes 7 figures a month. 📉 Revenue was unstable, unpredictable — always playing catch-up. 🚪 And every time I tried to scale, it felt like I was plugging holes faster than I could grow.
I thought hiring more people would give me freedom. Instead, I ended up busier than ever — managing people, solving problems.
90% of my day was firefighting: Endless meetings. Slack pings. “Cae, can I check with you real quick?” “Cae, this thing’s stuck — can you help?”
And the worst part?
The more I hired, the heavier things got.
Because the problem wasn’t the number of people… It was the wrong people.
One wrong hire? You can recover. But one wrong hire in the wrong season? It poisons your team culture. It turns your A-players into B-players.
And instead of buying my freedom, I bought more pressure. Instead of removing myself from operations, I became the bottleneck.
And every night, I’d lie in bed asking myself:
“What’s the next move?” “Should I launch again?” “Should I open a new offer?” “Why does it feel harder every month, not easier?”
I did everything I could. ✅ Worked longer hours ✅ Slept less ✅ Hired every expert ✅ Attended all the business masterminds ✅ Read every strategy book
But no one… not a single one of them… could tell me WHEN to do what.




How come CEOs, founders like us… don’t have a 
decision system to follow?
Founder Timing Decision System™
Let me tell you the question that changed everything for me as a founder.
“How come CEOs, founders like us… don’t have a decision system?”
When you’re small, you’ve questions, you can ask your parents
When you’re in school you can ask teachers, but how about business owners?
We don’t need more frameworks. We don’t need more templates. We don’t need more noise.
What we need is a system that tells us clearly:
💡 When to hire 💡 When to pause 💡 When to launch 💡 When to refine 💡 What to focus on in the next 90 days — no guesswork.
Because as a founder, I used to think: “If I just hire more people, I’ll be free.” “If I just launch more offers, things will finally scale.” But instead… it buried me deeper.

🔹 “From Fear to Fortune — My Vision Story” (Full Script)
You know, people often ask me why I’m so obsessed with timing — why I believe that when you do something matters just as much as what you do.
I’ll tell you where it started.
When I was 16, a fortune teller looked me straight in the eye and said,
“You won’t live past 18. If you want to survive, you have to become a nun.”
Imagine hearing that as a teenager. I was terrified. For years, I lived under that shadow — every birthday after 16 felt like a countdown. And because of that fear, I became obsessed with finding why. Why would destiny decide that for me? Was life really written in stone?
At the same time, my parents’ business — which had been doing well for years — suddenly collapsed. They didn’t suddenly become bad at business. They were still hardworking, still good people. But no matter what they tried, nothing worked. Later, I discovered — it wasn’t about hard work. It was about timing. They were entering their Winter Da Yun — a phase meant for consolidation, not expansion.
That’s when everything clicked for me. I realized life isn’t random. There’s a rhythm — just like the seasons — and if you act out of season, you suffer. But when you move with the season, doors open naturally.
That’s when my fear turned into fascination. I started studying the very system that once frightened me — and instead of trying to escape my destiny, I learned how to decode it.
That journey became my purpose. Today, my vision is to help 100 million people use the wisdom of Chinese metaphysics to achieve wealth multiplication, lasting happiness, and control over their own destiny.
Because if someone once told me I wouldn’t even live past 18 — and now I’m here, building multiple companies and helping others do the same — then I know: Destiny isn’t fixed. It’s decoded. And when you understand your timing — your Da Yun — you stop fighting life, and start flowing with it.

Success Framework = Right Skill × Right Timing
Skill
Timing
Result
Founder Timing Decision System™
Now today… Let me show you a truth that most people never realise.
👉 Success is not just about skill. It’s skill × timing.
Think about it:
Strong skill + wrong timing = wasted energy.
Average skill + right timing = breakthrough.
Strong skill + right timing = wealth explosion.
That’s why you see someone who isn’t even as good as you suddenly jump 3 levels ahead — not because they’re smarter, but because they caught the green light.
Who here has seen this before? Someone less skilled, but they moved at the right time, and BOOM, they got the promotion, the deal, the recognition. (Type YES if you’ve seen it.)
So if success = skill × timing, then timing is not optional — it’s the multiplier, its the amplifier

  RIGHT MOVE + WRONG TIMING = FAILURE..
Founder Timing Decision System™
here’s the painful truth… 👉 Even if you make the right move… at the wrong time, it still turns into failure.
Think about it.
You expand your business in a Defend cycle — instead of growth, you bleed money.
You quit everything and not doing anything in a Reset cycle — instead of freedom, you regret it for years.
It’s not because you lack of talent or not work hard enough. It’s not because the move was wrong. It was the right move… at the wrong timing.
Let me ask you — who here has experienced this before? You did the ‘right thing.’ You studied, you prepared, you gave your best… but the result still didn’t come. (Type ME in the chat if you’ve felt this.)
👉 That’s why people get frustrated. They think: ‘Maybe I need more discipline. Maybe I need to work harder.’ But it’s not about effort. It’s about cycle.
And this is the shift I want you to see tonight: Timing doesn’t just multiply your success. It also magnifies your mistakes.
The good news? Once you can see your cycles, you don’t have to guess anymore. You’ll know when to move, when to wait, when to defend.
And that’s what we’re about to do together — check your chart, find your season, and see how timing has been shaping your results all along.”


SEASON
ONE MOVE
ONE METRIC
Founder Timing Decision System™
Now, let’s make this practical.
Every season has one right move. And every move has one metric that proves it’s working.
That’s it.


GROW
RESET
DEFEND
HARVEST
Founder Timing Decision System™
You know… once you understand your season, you don’t need to chase ten things at the same time. You just focus on the one move that actually matters right now.
👉 during spring - Grow — it’s your green light. 
👉during summer - its Harvest — your reward time. 
👉during autumn- its Defend — your shield protect time. 
👉during winter - its Reset — your fresh start. 
Most people don’t fail because they’re lazy. They fail because they’re doing everything… in the wrong season.



SEASON
ONE MOVE
ONE METRIC
Founder Timing Decision System™
So.. If you can match just these three things: Season → One Move → One Metric …you’ll stop wasting years, and you’ll see progress that actually sticks.
Now here’s what we’re going to do next: Let’s define the four seasons clearly first. Then I’ll show you exactly where to see your season in your chart.”
If that sounds good to you, type GOOD in the chat 



Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter
Founder Timing Decision System™
Alright, quick foundation so everything tonight makes sense.
Every single person here goes through these cycles — again and again. Some of you might be in spring, some in summer, some in autumn, some in winter.
And the key is: the right move in the wrong season will drain you. But the right move in the right season will pay you.
Let me explain with a few simple stories.



GROW
Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter
Expand
Launch
Hire
Founder Timing Decision System™
🌱 Grow — Spring Think of Grow as your green light season. This is when you’re supposed to launch, expand, move forward.
I had a student, a 50+ auntie who run a small bakery shop. For years she hesitated to open a second branch — always waiting for “perfect time.” When her Grow cycle came, I told her, “Just do it.” She did a soft launch — only pre-orders, no fancy setup. Within two weeks, she was flooded with orders.
That’s Grow season. The doors open easier. People say yes faster. If she had stayed in planning mode, she would’ve missed it.


GROW
HARVEST
Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter
Expand
Launch
Hire
Monetize
Raise price
Cash in
Founder Timing Decision System™
☀️ Harvest — Summer Now, Harvest is different. It’s not the time to start new things — it’s the time to collect, leverage on what you already have. 
One uncle I coached was in property. In Harvest, I told him, “Stop hunting for 10 more deals. Just sell the ones you already hold.” He listened, sold 2 properties, took profit, and held few hundred thousand cash. If he had kept chasing more, he would’ve been stuck later.
Harvest is about enjoying the fruit you planted. Double down on what works, cash in, and enjoy the reward.


GROW
DEFEND
HARVEST
Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter
Expand
Launch
Hire
Monetize
Raise price
Cash in
Secure
Cut leaks
Protect base
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Now let’s talk about Defend — your autumn season.
A lot of people misunderstand this. They think Defend means ‘I cannot do anything. I must hide.’ That’s not true.
Defend is not punishment. It’s your safety net season.
This is when you stop the bleeding, patch up holes, and strengthen your foundation — so that when your next Grow or Harvest comes, you can leap even higher.
Let me give you a simple story.
I had a client who ran a small trading business. In his Defend cycle, he wanted to take a big loan and expand into new trucks. Honestly, if he did that, he’d be drowning in debt today.
Instead, I told him: ‘This is not the season for big expansion. This is the season to protect your base.’ So he focused on renegotiating supplier contracts, clearing out dead stock, and tightening how his team handled orders.
From the outside, it didn’t look “good” No new trucks, no ribbon-cutting. But because of that, he entered his next Grow cycle debt-free, lean, and ready. That’s when he doubled his profits safely.
👉 That’s the power of Defend. It’s not about shrinking. It’s about protecting what you’ve already built, cutting leaks, and building resilience.
When you do Defend right, you save yourself years of mistakes. And when the season turns, you’re the one who has cash, clarity, and energy to seize the opportunity.
So remember: Defend is not a step back. It’s the springboard for your comeback.


GROW
RESET
DEFEND
HARVEST
Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter
Expand
Launch
Hire
Monetize
Raise price
Cash in
Secure
Cut leaks
Protect base
Reskill
Prepare quietly
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Finally, let’s talk about Reset — your winter season.
Now, a lot of people panic when they hear ‘Reset.’ They think: ‘Wah, does that mean I cannot do anything? Must I just sit and suffer?’ That’s not true at all.
Reset is not the end. It’s the reload & rebuild season.
Think about farmers: in winter, they don’t harvest. But it doesn’t mean they’re lazy. They’re repairing tools, preparing seeds, and planning the next planting. When spring comes, they’re ready.
It’s the same with your chart. In Reset, you’re not meant to force huge changes or expansion. But you ARE meant to rebuild — new skills, new systems, new networks.
One auntie came to me and said: ‘Cae, I feel useless. I work, I try, but everything keep on fall apart. Maybe I’m just not good enough.’ We checked her chart — she was in Reset. I told her: ‘Don’t force growth now. This is your season to reload & rebuild quietly.’
So she focused on learning. Took a course. Rebuilt her personal finances. Reset her priorities.
few months later, when her Grow cycle started, she didn’t just crawl out — she shot forward. Because she had the new skills and systems ready to fire.
👉 That’s Reset. It’s not about being stuck. It’s about quietly sharpening your sword, so when the season flips, you cut through faster than anyone else.
So don’t ever fear Reset. Smart people love Reset — because they know this is when the real preparation happens.”
For those of you who mentioned you wanna achieve your goals in the next 3-6 months, it’s super critical to know about your season so you know exactly what to do next.

Let me show you a quick one from a business owners — Kelvin. He runs an interior design business.
So Kelvin texted us and said —
“Cae… I gotta tell you this 😂 remember that client I said I might skip? End up I followed your green light timing thing and took it. We closed RM240k project last week 😳 Honestly, I almost didn’t go for it... if I didn’t check with you that day, I confirm miss this deal already. Timing thing really works la... now I plan my whole Q4 also based on that 😂”
Now… what’s powerful about this is — Kelvin didn’t change his product, he didn’t suddenly double his team, he didn’t even give discount.
He just changed his timing strategy. That one decision — whether to move or hold — turned into a RM240k project.
That’s why I always say — when you catch your green light, you don’t have to force things. The opportunities come toward you.

"Not every decade is built for scaling fast. You don’t have to be aggressive all the time.  Some decades are meant for building, some for harvesting, and some for surviving quietly."
"Within each  da yun, your personal Wealth Stars move into different palaces. Sometimes they activate career success. Sometimes they are blocked by emotional drama, betrayal, health issues. You can see it coming if you know how to read the chart."
example:
"If you plant in the right cycle, you double your results with half the effort. If you move in a resistance cycle, you work 10x harder for half the reward."

“When I read her Zi Wei chart — her Wealth Window didn’t even start yet. She was in a Rest Phase. The stars were showing resistance — not momentum.”
“I told her: ‘You didn’t fail because your idea was bad. You moved before the season opened.’”

✅ Then Transition to Resolution:
“We paused her biz efforts. I advised her to go back to work — but position herself in a job that had future ownership potential. She joined a childcare center admin role…Around 6 months later, the owner offered her partnership in a second branch.”

Founder Timing Decision System™
“Normally When I decode someone’s chart in a private consultation, I don’t just look at the Wealth Palace. I look at timing — specifically the 10-year Major Luck Periods, which we call ‘大限’.”
“Each person’s 大限 is different — someone’s wealth window might open from age 28–38. For someone else, maybe 42–52.”
—---------

“So if you’re just looking at the surface of your app — that’s like looking at the title of a book. When we go deep into your 大限 chart, I can literally tell you:
Which year to switch jobs
Which month to launch
Which years to avoid big risks That’s what I normally do inside Consultation - and of course you’ll be able to learn that during our 3 days destiny workshop too.”

✅ TEACH POINT 1: Every 10 years, your chart shifts — and tells you what to focus on.
“Sometimes it tells you to build. Sometimes it says: rest. Sometimes it says: focus on health, or family, or long-term compounding.”
“The problem? Most people don’t listen — they just keep forcing the same moves, year after year.”
“That’s why you’ll see people working harder — but getting worse results.”
✅ TEACH POINT 2: When you go against your chart, life hits you. Hard.
Later we will go through a few real life case studies
🧠 Wrap-up Line:
“The chart always speaks. But if you don’t read it — life will speak louder, through breakdowns, heartbreak, or money loss.”
“That’s why decoding your 10-year cycle is not optional — it’s the difference between scaling with flow… or crashing without warning.”


Let’s Check Your Timing Right Now
Founder Timing Decision System™



Find the Yellow Palace 
in your chart
Founder Timing Decision System™
Alright, so earlier we talked about how your Zi Wei chart has 12 palaces, right? Each palace represents a theme or sector of your life — like your Wealth Palace shows how you earn and manage money, your Career Palace shows your direction, your Parents Palace shows relationship dynamics with your parents, and so on.
Now, beyond these palaces, your chart also divides your entire life into 12 chapters — each chapter represents one big cycle of 10 years, and that’s what we call Dayun (大运).
Think of it like reading your own autobiography:
Every 10 years, you turn a new chapter.
The palace your Dayun currently sits in tells you what kind of story you’re living through now.
That’s why it’s so powerful — because once you know where your Dayun is sitting, you immediately know which season you’re in right now.
Type “1” in the chat if you’ve already found which palace your Dayun is currently sitting in. 👇

DEMO IN APP emphasize if you’re on the last year of dayun cycle - sp1
Show word dayun in the chart
Match back the yellow palace, see which year you’re in now
First year then first year
For those of you who have less than 5 years of your dayun cycle, you must maximize it, even if you’re on the last year only you still need to maximize it don’t waste it + start seeing for next dayun already
For those of you who just started your dayun, do planning
“Every 10 years, your life enters a new season — and your chart will show you which palace you’re living in right now.”
”
“You’re not meant to chase everything at once. Your 10-year cycle tells you what to focus on now — so you stop forcing what’s not meant for this phase.”


Why is it so important to know your 10 year major luck cycle?
(10sec)
Founder Timing Decision System™
 “This is your current Dayun — your 10-year cycle. This decides your season.”
Every 10 years, your life enters a new season — And your chart will show you exactly which palace you’re living in right now.
That palace sets the theme of your life for the entire decade. Are you in your career-building phase? Your health-repair season? Or your family-duty chapter?
You’re not meant to chase everything at once. The 10-year cycle tells you what to focus on now — so you stop forcing things that were never meant for this phase.
Because here’s the truth — most people live reactively. They follow what the world says: “Start a biz now. Get married now. Quit your job now.” But they never stop to ask — “Is this even my season to move?”
That’s why so many end up burning out, losing money, or feeling stuck.
The Ten-Years Luck cycle chart is significant because a lot of  things happened or about to be happened in our lives can  be analyzed in this layer of the chart. 
These include acquiring  or disposing a property, a car, migration, lawsuit or litigation,  marriage or divorce, health issues, changing career, major life  decisions, business investments, venturing into stocks or  speculative earnings, etc 
The 10-Year Cycle solves this.
✅ It shows you the core focus of your life right now — so you stop wasting energy on the wrong things. ✅ It shows you where the universe is supporting you — so you start seeing flow again. ✅ And it helps you avoid wasting 5, even 10 years, on a path that was never going to lead anywhere.
When you know which palace you're living in, you’ll know what to prioritize, what to pause, and what to double down on — without guilt.
This could be your first year of the cycle… or your final year. Either way — you better maximize it.
🔥 But here's something most people overlook:
Yes — pay attention to the cycle you're in right now. But don't only focus on your own cycle.
As I go through more case studies — you might realize: “Wait… that’s not my current cycle — but it’s my next one.” Or maybe it sounds like your partner, your kid, or even your parent.
Don’t zone out. Absorb as much as you can.
Because all this isn’t just astrology. It’s practical strategy you can apply in your real life — to support the people you love, plan ahead, and stop walking in the dark.
So stop living in guesswork. And start playing your decade like a pro.





SPRING
GROW SEASON = EXPAND, GROW, MOVE
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Let’s talk about Spring. Spring is the season of growth, expansion, and new beginnings. It’s the season where the energy shifts — 🌱 the universe is literally saying to you: 👉 ‘Go. Build. Launch. Move.’
If your 10-year cycle is in Spring, this is not the season to waste.(nonid)  ❌ This is not the time to hide behind a ‘wait and see’ mentality. ❌ This is not the time to stay stuck in routines that no longer challenge you. This is your window to build something bigger.
(continue)
But I know… for many of you here, especially those who’ve been working in corporate for 10, 15, even 20 years, you might be feeling this strange disconnect lately.
Maybe the environment around you has shifted. Leadership changed. Company direction pivoted. Politics got heavier. Or maybe the culture simply doesn’t feel the same anymore.
You’re showing up every day, doing your job well — but deep down, there’s this voice whispering, “I’m meant for more… but where do I even start?”
Some of you have been in the same company for a very long time. You’ve climbed the ladder, built your reputation, you know everyone. But at the same time… you also know, if you keep staying in the same position, doing the same thing, 👉 you’ll slowly plateau. And Spring will pass you by without you even realizing it.
Spring is not a waiting season. Spring is a building season. It’s the time to expand your role, build new networks, plant new seeds.
—--------------------------------
If your 10-year cycle sits in Career Palace, Travel Palace, or Friends/Siblings Palace — 🚀 this is your moment to launch new initiatives, explore new opportunities, and leverage your network.
Because 5 or 10 years from now, you’ll either say: “I’m glad I moved when Spring arrived.” Or you’ll say: “That was my moment… and I stayed still.”

& Growth
“If your 10-year cycle is sitting in your Career Palace during Spring… I want you to be honest with yourself — Are you really playing at the level this season is calling for?
Many people in this position — especially those who’ve been in corporate, same company, same industry, running for businesses for years — start to feel stuck at the same level. The job is stable. The responsibilities are familiar. Everyone respects you. But deep down, there’s that nagging thought: ‘I’ve been here for a while… what’s next for me?’
Some of you notice your career visibility has dropped. New faces are getting the spotlight. The company is shifting focus — restructuring, layoffs — and you start worrying… ‘What if the next one is me?’ Suddenly it feels like you’re not growing anymore.
Or maybe you’ve started to play it safe. You know you’re capable of more, but you’ve adapted to the routine. You feel like you don’t have a choice — even if you don’t agree with the direction, you just accept it. You wait passively for opportunities to appear. No more spark. No more excitement.
But when Spring hits your Career Palace, this is your fight season. This is the moment to step into bigger roles, take ownership of bigger responsibilities. Your years of experience are not a burden — they’re your biggest advantage.
And I know this because during 1-on-1 sessions, many of you tell me the same things: ❌ “I’m too old already, nobody values me anymore.” ❌ “My boss won’t promote me la, they only focus on the younger ones.” ❌ “I’ll just wait first… see how the company direction goes.” ❌ “Aiya, what can I do? Things are like that already.”
And my question to you is always — Then what? Just wait for a miracle? Why can’t you use your years of experience as your leverage? Why can’t you upgrade yourself, invest in yourself, reposition yourself before the environment forces you to?
You know AI is the trend right now, why you put your age as an excuse instead of catching up the trends?
🌱 Spring doesn’t wait. If you stay too quiet during this period, you’re wasting your Spring — and someone else will plant the seeds that were meant for you.”

Step out of your comfort zone
Grow by changing your environment
SPRING
Grow Season
Founder Timing Decision System™
Travel Palace:
Step Outside Comfort Zone
“Now… if your Spring season falls into your Travel Palace — this is usually a huge opportunity season. But for many people, this is also the most easily wasted season.
Here’s why. The moment I mention ‘Travel Palace’, a lot of people immediately think — ✈️ “Holiday season ah!” Sure, go ahead — enjoy your hard-earned money on a vacation, that’s fine. But what this really refers to… is your external environment. And your external environment influences your energy, your mindset, and your decision-making power far more than you realize.
Think about your work situation. Many people — especially those who’ve been in the same company or same role for many years — get too used to their environment. They’ve built their routines. Their comfort zones. Their little safe circles. And when the chart is literally telling you: 👉 ‘Move. Explore. Expand.’ They freeze. They don’t want to leave their comfort bed — because it’s just too comfortable.
Some of you might already feel this. You sense the company is changing direction. Your role no longer feels like it’s growing. You’ve thought about shifting — new market, new department, maybe even a new job offer… but you keep telling yourself, “Maybe later… I’ll wait until things are more stable. Not the right time yet.”
And for retirees, this shows up differently. You might think, “Going out, changing environment… not for me. I just want stability.” But here’s the truth — even after retirement, your environment still shapes your energy. Spring in Travel Palace is a sign that life is asking you to step outside, not shrink in.
During 1-on-1s, I hear the same lines again and again: ❌ “I’m too old to make changes.” ❌ “I don’t want to start over somewhere new.” ❌ “Later la, when I’m more ready.” ❌ “I’m used to this already — why rock the boat?”
But Spring in Travel Palace is exactly the right time to make that shift. 🌍 This is the season when new doors open through movement, through new environments, new networks, new perspectives. If you keep staying in the same lane, doing the same thing, in the same space… you’ll miss the window to grow through exploration.
Don’t let comfort make you stagnant. This season is literally pushing you to step out.”

Friends Palace:

Your Network
“And if your Spring season lands in your Friends Palace, this one is sneaky — because many corporate professionals underestimate it.
Let’s be real. When you’ve been in the same company for years, it’s easy to become very inward-focused. You deal with your team, your department, your usual circle. Your network becomes comfortable, not expanding.
But here’s the pain: Some of you have started feeling like your opportunities are drying up. You see other people advancing — not because they’re smarter, but because they’re better connected.
Or maybe your social circle hasn’t changed in years, you say you’re an introvert, you don’t like making friends — No fresh collaborations. No new perspectives. And as a result, your career feels stuck in the same loop.
But Spring in Friends Palace is a season where your growth comes through people. 👥 It’s not about doing everything alone — it’s about reconnecting, collaborating, building influence, and activating your network.
If you stay isolated during this period, you’re basically trying to plant seeds in an empty field. But when you plug into your network strategically, this season can open massive doors for you.”




STAY COMFORTABLE IN SPRING = 
BIG WASTE
(AND YOU DON’T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN…) 
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Spring is not here for you to stay comfortable. If you choose to remain where it feels safe — same job, same routine, same circle — it may feel stable in the short term… but what you’re actually doing is quietly missing your prime growth window.
Here’s what happens when that window slips by — 🌱 The momentum that should’ve been planted in Spring… never gets planted. 🌾 When Summer arrives, there’s nothing to harvest. 🍂 When Autumn comes, you’re forced to defend what hasn’t even grown. ❄️ And by Winter… you’re left asking, ‘Where did the last 10 years go?’
That is the real cost. Not some dramatic crash. But a slow, quiet drift. Year after year… opportunities pass, potential fades, and comfort slowly turns into regret.
So if you know you’re in your Spring Season — Don’t waste it sitting still. Don’t settle for ‘okay’. This is the season to expand, to launch, to hire, to fight for more. 🌱 Because this window doesn’t repeat twice.”



SUMMER
HARVEST SEASON = ACTIVATE, LEVERAGE, MONETIZATION
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Alright… let’s talk about Summer. Summer is what I call your Harvest Season — ☀️ it’s the time to cash in, to monetize, to collect the fruits of everything you’ve worked so hard to build before this.
By the time Summer comes, you’re not starting from zero anymore. You already have something — 💰 You’ve built up some savings or capital. 🧠 You’ve collected skills, knowledge, and experience over the years. 👥 You have a network, resources, maybe even a good reputation in your industry.
But here’s the problem — most people don’t treat Summer like their harvest season. Instead of using what they already have, they keep waiting… searching for the “next big thing”… or worse — they sit on it, doing nothing.
Some people say, “I need to learn more first.” Some keep overthinking and doubting themselves. And some… they’re literally sitting on a goldmine, but they never do anything with it. The season passes, and they wonder why nothing changed.
❌ Let me be very clear — Summer is not the season to build from scratch. ✅ Summer is the season to activate what you already have, and turn it into real results.
Think about it. You’ve worked for years, collected skills, knowledge, contacts, maybe even assets — Why let all that sit there, collecting dust? This is the time to make it work for you.
Some of you have side projects or ideas you never launched. Some of you have years of expertise that you’ve never packaged or monetized. Some of you are sitting on opportunities, waiting for a “perfect sign” to move. But the truth is — ⏰ your Summer season clock is ticking.
If you don’t harvest during Summer, you’ll walk into Autumn with empty hands. And when Winter comes, you’ll look back and think, “I actually had everything I needed… I just didn’t use it.”
So listen carefully — 👉 Stop waiting. 👉 Stop underestimating what you already have. 👉 Start taking action.
Summer rewards execution, not hesitation. This is your season to monetize, to collect, to make things happen. Don’t waste it.”

Wealth Palace:
Activate Your Resources
“Alright, let’s talk about Wealth Palace. Summer here is your harvest season — this is the time to cash in, to monetize the resources you’ve built so far.
Every time I mention the word ‘resources’, I can already see some faces like 😳 The first reaction is always — ‘But I don’t have anything wor…’
Guys — come on. If you’ve worked 10, 20, 30 years, don’t tell me you have nothing. Think properly: 👉 What’s your best strength? 👉 What skills have you built up along the way? 👉 What networks have you formed? 👉 What investments or savings have you slowly accumulated?
All of these — your skills, knowledge, experience, networks, capital, investments — are your resources.
If you say you don’t have any, honestly, it’s either: ❌ you’re over-analyzing the word ‘resources’, or ❌ you’re just not grateful for your life.
Even a beggar on the street knows to sit at the most crowded area to get more donations. That’s him using his resources. So how about you? 
You’ve worked for decades. You have far more than you think.
The real issue isn’t that you don’t have resources. The issue is — you’re not activating them.
For example, some of you have been putting money into investments or stocks for years. But the way you treat it… honestly, it’s like a parking lot. You just leave the money there, close one eye, and hope something good happens by itself.
But be honest with yourself — when was the last time you actually reviewed your portfolio properly? 🧐 Do you know which parts are performing, and which are dragging you down? Do you even have any SOP or system for decision-making? Or are you just following what your friend, your cousin, or some random ‘guru’ told you 5 years ago?
💰 Have you ever considered shifting, restructuring, or cashing out strategically to lock in profits? Or are you still holding blindly, waiting for some miracle to happen?
And here’s the brutal truth — some of you already know you’ve been following the wrong strategy or the wrong mentor for years. But you ignore it. Why? Because it’s easier to stay comfortable than to make a tough decision.
❌ This is exactly how people waste their Summer season. They have resources. They have capital. They have time. But they don’t activate it. They just park, wait, and hope.
Then there are those of you sitting on valuable skills. You’ve led teams, solved problems, trained people, built expertise — but you keep everything in you, like some museum piece. Why not package and monetize your skillset? Why not teach, consult, or create something on the side? You don’t need to reinvent everything from scratch — you just need to ACTIVATE what you already have.
And let’s talk about networks. Some of you have decades worth of connections — ex-colleagues, clients, industry friends… but you never leverage them. You scroll LinkedIn and say, ‘Wah, this person so lucky.’ It’s not luck. It’s activation. They reached out. You didn’t.
💥 Summer in Wealth Palace is not about waiting for a brand-new opportunity to fall from the sky. It’s about opening your eyes to what’s already in your hands and asking yourself: 👉 ‘Where can I cash in?’ 👉 ‘Which of my resources can I use to create returns, fast?’
Because If you don’t harvest during Summer, you’ll walk into Autumn with empty hands. And when Winter comes, you’ll look back and realize… The opportunities were already around me. I just didn’t use them.”

Founder Timing Decision System™
Property Palace:
Leverage Your Foundation
“Next, let’s talk about Property Palace. This represents your foundations  - now what do i mean by foundations?
For some of you, this is very literal: 🏡 Maybe it’s property, a business, or some investments you’ve made years ago. 👥 Or it could be your network, your reputation, your systems — basically the things you’ve built steadily over the years.
These are powerful foundations. But here’s the problem — many people spend years building them, and when Summer comes… they don’t actually collect. They just leave these foundations there, untouched, underutilized.
❌ They don’t optimize. ❌ They don’t upgrade. ❌ They don’t leverage.
Summer in Property Palace is not about starting something new from zero. It’s about looking at what you already have and asking yourself: 👉 Where can this foundation give me more returns? 👉 How can I make what I own work harder for me?
Let me give you a real example. Some of you say, “My properties cannot make money one lah.” But the question is — have you actually done your homework? 📝 Did you do proper market research to understand what tenants or buyers want now? Or you just simply leave it to some random property agent? 🧍‍♂️ if that's the case, Are you still using the same property agent who hasn’t brought you any results for years? 🛠 Have you ever thought of renovating or upgrading the place to match current tenant expectations?
You complain it’s not working… but often, it’s because you stopped working the asset. You’re sitting on a goldmine, but treating it like a rock.
Same goes for family support. Some of you are blessed — your family supports you, your kids take care of you, or your siblings help out. That’s also part of your foundation. But ask yourself honestly: 🤔 When they support you, do you also support them back? Or do you just argue and create tension at home?
A strong family foundation can open many doors — emotionally, financially, and strategically. But if all you do is take without giving back, that foundation weakens over time.
So it’s time to upgrade, expand smartly, or cash in strategically. it’s time to use this foundation as a leverage to open new doors, instead of letting it collect dust.
🏡 Summer in Property Palace = leverage what you’ve built. If you ignore it, you’re literally leaving money and opportunities lying on the table.”

“The Wellbeing Palace is one of the most underestimated parts of your entire chart. Most people spend their whole life chasing wealth... but they never realise, their Wealth Palace only tells half the story.
Because the truth is — your outer wealth is nothing more than a reflection of your inner state.
If your Wealth Palace shows what you do to make money, then your Wellbeing Palace reveals who you must become to attract it.
And that’s why I call it your Hidden Money Palace.
You can have the best strategies, the right timing, even the perfect opportunities... but if your inner pattern is off — if you’re constantly overthinking, doubting yourself, or operating from fear instead of power — you’ll keep sabotaging your wealth without even realising it.
That’s the scary part — because this palace controls the unseen half of your chart. It’s like the engine beneath the surface: you don’t notice it until it breaks down. And when it’s unbalanced, it silently eats away your energy, your clarity, and your confidence to execute.
But when you activate it the right way, everything starts compounding. Your instincts sharpen. You start saying ‘yes’ to the right opportunities, and ‘no’ to distractions that used to drain you. Money flows smoother — not because you’re working harder, but because you’ve aligned your inner rhythm with your Wealth Palace.
That’s why in every chart of top performers and business owners I’ve seen — their Wellbeing Palace is awakened. They’ve learned how to maximise their inner superpower — the exact energy that makes people trust them, follow them, and open doors for them.
So if you’ve been feeling like you’re doing everything right, but your results just don’t match your effort — don’t look for another strategy yet. Look here first.
Because your hidden money, your hidden pattern, and your next level of wealth activation are all sitting right inside your Wellbeing Palace.”

Your Da Yun gives you the big roadmap. But your Liunian? That’s the GPS rerouting in real time. It’s the pulse that tells you what to do this year — move, build, protect, or reset.
So maybe this year, you suddenly feel this strange urge to quit your job. Or maybe you keep thinking, “It’s time to build something of my own.” Maybe you’re craving expansion — to finally grow your brand, step out, and be seen.
You’ve never felt this kind of pull before — but somehow, this year just feels different.
That’s not coincidence. That’s your Liunian Summer season kicking in — your chart literally telling you, “Hey, the door’s open. It’s time to move.”
So right now, say it out loud — “It’s time to move now.” If you’re watching this live with your family, partner, or friends — turn to them and tell them, “It’s time to move now.”
Because here’s the brutal truth — if you don’t harvest during Summer, you’ll walk into Autumn with empty hands. And when Winter hits, you’ll look back and realise… the opportunities were right there, but you hesitated.

“Alright… let’s talk about Autumn. If Spring is about growing, and Summer is about harvesting — 🍂 Autumn is about defending.
Now, what does ‘defending’ actually mean? It’s simple. 👉 Cut what’s not necessary. Remove the noise, the drama, the distractions — and get laser focused on what actually matters.
And let’s be real — this is the part most people struggle with. Because cutting means facing reality. It means admitting that some things you’ve been holding onto for way too long… are no longer serving you.
But Autumn doesn’t care about your feelings. Autumn only cares about 2Fs —when i mention F word, it’s not the F word that you’re thinking now ya haha - its Focus and Facts.
Too many people walk into Autumn still carrying nonsense from Spring and Summer… ❌ Projects they should’ve dropped long ago.
 ❌ company they should left tong time go  ❌ Toxic people they keep tolerating. ❌ Emotional drama they allow to play on repeat.
But Autumn doesn’t reward clutter. It rewards clarity, focus, and fact-based decisions — not feelings.
This is the season to be brutally honest with yourself: 👉 What’s actually moving the needle? 👉 What’s just noise? 👉 Who belongs in your next season… and who doesn’t?
🍂 If you don’t cut what’s weighing you down now, you’ll drag it all into Winter — and trust me, that’s when it hurts the most.”

🍂 This season is the time to trim the fat. Cut the unnecessary drama. Bring issues into the light, not keep them under the rug. Align, or make tough calls if you have to.

Siblings Palace:
Filter Your 
Circle
“Next up — Siblings Palace. And again, this doesn’t just mean your literal brothers and sisters. This represents your friends, peers, your collaborators — basically, your circle.
🍂 Autumn here is where a lot of people get caught. Why? Because this palace exposes who’s actually adding value to your life… and who’s just adding noise.
So let me ask you 👇 👉 Who’s in your circle that’s actually pushing you forward? 👉 And who’s just… taking up space?
Some of you already know. You’ve got people around you who gossip, complain, or distract you every time you’re focused. But you keep them there anyway. Why? ‘Aiya… old friend mah.’
🍂 Autumn doesn’t reward sentimentality. It rewards clarity and focus.
This is the season to clean up your circle. Identify the real alliances — the people who challenge you, support you, grow with you. And cut the noise — the surface-level connections that keep you looping.
And this doesn’t mean you have to be cold or ruthless. It just means you stop pretending that everyone in your circle is meant to follow you into your next season.
Because if you don’t filter it now, those same distracting voices will follow you into Winter — and they’ll cloud your focus exactly when you need it to be sharp.”

Children Palace:
Clarify Your 
Legacy
“Alright… let’s talk about Children Palace. Now — before some of you switch off thinking, ‘I don’t have kids, this one not for me’ — hold up. This palace has two layers: 👨‍👩‍👧 For those who have children, yes — it reflects your role as a parent. 🏗 But for everyone else, it also represents your legacy — the assets, knowledge, and impact you’re building for the next generation.
So let’s start with the parents first. 🍂 Autumn here isn’t about how to raise your kids. It’s about being brutally honest with your emotions.
Some of you love your children so much that you’ve become over-attached without realising. You carry their problems like they’re your own. You worry even when things are actually fine. And you get stuck in these emotional loops — guilt, fear, frustration — but nothing actually changes.
Be honest with yourself for a second 👇 👉 Are you supporting them wisely… or just reacting emotionally? 👉 Are you looking at facts… or letting worry run the show?
🍂 Autumn here is the season to cut unnecessary emotional drama. To stop letting old habits and fears drain your energy. Focus on what’s real. What do they actually need from you right now? And what are you worrying about just because you’ve always worried about it?
If you don’t clean this up in Autumn, you’ll carry that emotional heaviness into Winter — and trust me, that’s when it hits the hardest.
Now, for those of you who don’t have children — don’t think you get a free pass here 😏 Because this palace is very relevant to you too.
Children Palace is also about your legacy. 🏗 What you’ve built. The knowledge you’ve accumulated. The assets, the systems, the impact you want to leave behind.
And let’s be real — some of you have built a lot over the years. Businesses. Investments. Skills. Expertise. But if I asked you right now, “Is it structured clearly?” Many of you would hesitate.
🍂 Autumn doesn’t reward vague hopes. It rewards clarity.
So ask yourself 👇 👉 What exactly am I building that can be passed down, scaled, or remembered? 👉 Is my legacy tight… or is it just a pile of ‘one day I’ll sort it out’ ideas?
Some of you have everything scattered — no clear plan, no proper structure. You’re just assuming it’ll all work out. But assumptions don’t survive Winter.
This is the season to tighten things up. Trim what’s outdated. Structure what matters. Stop emotionally procrastinating and actually face it.
Because if you don’t… those blind spots follow you straight into Winter. And when time is no longer on your side — that’s when it gets expensive.”

Parents Palace:
Face Truth, 
Step Up
“Alright… let’s wrap up Autumn with Parents Palace. Now, when I say Parents Palace — I don’t just mean your mum and dad. I’m also talking about your bosses, your seniors, your mentors — the people who are ahead of you, above you, who shape the environment you’re in.
And this palace… is where a lot of old stuff shows up. Old stories. Old emotional patterns. Things from the past that you thought didn’t matter anymore… but they still quietly shape how you see the world today.
Some of you — if you’re honest — you’re still carrying your childhood narratives. You’re still reacting to life using fears that were formed 10, 20, 30 years ago.
Let me ask you this: 👉 Are those patterns helping you right now… or are they actually holding you back?
Some of you blame the way you were raised. Some of you blame the family you were born into. Some of you carry fear because of the reality we live in today.
And look — I’m not denying that. It’s real. I get it. Your past may have shaped you. It probably did. But listen carefully — 🍂 Autumn is not the season to let your past control your future.
This is not the time to keep pointing back at childhood, or family, or fear, and say, “It’s because of that, that’s why I’m like this.”
No. ❌ Autumn doesn’t reward fear. ❌ Autumn doesn’t reward feelings. ✅ Autumn rewards clarity, responsibility, and truth.
Yes — your past happened. But at some point… you’ve got to stop running from it. You face it. You own it. And you step up.
Because if you don’t… You’ll keep dragging those same old stories into every new season of your life. And Winter? Winter will still come — whether you’re ready or not.”




WINTER
RESET SEASON = 
RESKILL, PAUSE, PREPARE
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Alright, let’s talk about ❄️ Winter Season.
Spring is for launching. Summer is for collecting. Autumn is for protecting. But Winter… Winter is the season where most people lose the game without even knowing it.
They see no instant reward, so they freeze. They stop moving. They tell themselves, “I’ll wait till it feels right again.” And that — right there — is how momentum dies.
Because here’s the truth — Winter is your pressure test. It exposes every crack you ignored when times were easy. It shows whether you were truly building wealth, or just surfing momentum.
When everyone else is taking a break, the ones who win? They’re rebuilding their arsenal. They’re studying what broke. They’re stacking their skills. They’re planning their next strike.
You don’t “rest” in Winter — you reset your power.
Let me be blunt — if you waste this season trying to “feel ready,” you’re already late for the next 10-year wave.
By the time Spring arrives, it’s too late to start preparing. The game has already moved. And you’ll be the one playing catch-up — tired, frustrated, wondering why opportunities always pass you by.
So if you’re in Winter right now, stop waiting for the light. This is the light. Winter isn’t punishment — it’s your setup.
You either use it to rebuild and come back dangerous… or stay comfortable and become irrelevant.
There’s no in-between.
Winter doesn’t care how you feel. It only rewards those who prepare.”

Health Palace:
Prevention > Cure
“Let’s talk about your Health Palace.
And I want you to really pay attention — because this part can make or break your next season.
Some of you here… you’ve been running on empty for years. You’re the problem-solver, the breadwinner, the one everyone depends on. And you keep telling yourself, “I’ll rest later… once this project is done.” “I’ll slow down after this busy month.” “I’ll fix my body after things stabilize.”
But let’s be real — ‘later’ has been your excuse for the last 5 years. And the truth? Later eventually becomes too late.
If you’ve ever been through a health scare — a surgery, a fall, a sudden illness — that wasn’t bad luck. That was your chart screaming for your attention. It was your body forcing you to stop what your mind refused to.
You can ignore signs for a while, but the bill always comes due — and it’s never cheap.
⚠️ That random chest pain you brushed off. ⚠️ That headache and fatigue that you called “normal.” ⚠️ The sleep you never get, but keep compensating with caffeine. ⚠️ The headaches you label as “just stress.”
All of that… are warnings. And if you keep waiting until it becomes a problem, you’re already too late.
Here’s the cold truth — You can rebuild money, but you can’t rebuild health on command. And when health collapses, wealth follows. Because no matter how strong your chart is, if your body can’t carry the energy, everything else fails.
Winter is not downtime — it’s your last warning window. This is when you’re supposed to repair, recalibrate, and restore. It’s the only time the universe gives you permission to pause before something breaks.
So if your chart shows Winter or Health activation — don’t take this lightly. Don’t wait for a doctor to tell you what you already know deep down. Don’t wait for pain to become panic.
Slow down now — before you’re forced to. Because when Spring hits, you’ll need your full strength to rise again. And if you burn out now, you won’t even make it to the start line.
This is not about being weak. It’s about being wise.
Winter doesn’t destroy you — it tests whether you’re smart enough to protect what matters most.”

“Now let’s talk about your Life Palace.
And honestly — this is where Winter either resets your destiny or repeats your burnout cycle.
Most of you spend all year pouring into everyone else. Your business. Your team. Your family. You fix everyone’s problems… but you’ve forgotten who’s supposed to fix you.
Let me ask you straight — 👉 When was the last time you actually invested in yourself? Not your company. Not your kids. Not your boss. You.
If your answer is “I can’t remember,” that’s exactly why you keep hitting the same ceiling every year.
Because no matter how much you hustle, if the person driving the vehicle isn’t growing, the whole machine stalls.
Here’s the truth nobody tells you — Your Life Palace isn’t about doing more. It’s about becoming more.
❄️ Winter is not a downtime — it’s a mirror. It shows you everything you’ve ignored. Every dream you’ve postponed. Every version of yourself you buried under responsibility.
And if you don’t use this season to rebuild yourself — your next 10 years will look exactly like your last 10.
So stop waiting for “someday.” That course you’ve been eyeing? Take it. That skill you’ve been avoiding? Learn it. That thing you know could change your life? Do it now.
Because here’s the brutal truth — If you don’t grow, nothing around you will. Your business won’t expand. Your wealth won’t multiply. Your relationships won’t evolve.
You are the foundation. And if the foundation cracks, everything above it crumbles — fast.
So this Winter, stop being everyone else’s hero. Be your own.
Use this window to rebuild your edge. Upgrade your mind. Rewire your habits. Invest in the version of you that your next chapter requires.
Because if you don’t? You’ll be the same person, fighting the same problems, next Winter — still wondering why nothing’s changing.
Winter gives you one shot to reprogram your destiny. Use it — or lose it.”

“Now… how do you know if you’re actually in your Winter Season?
Simple — You can also spot it from your Liunian chart. Because Liunian reveals what kind of energy this year is pushing you into.
If lately you’ve been feeling lost, like your old drive doesn’t hit the same anymore... If deep down, you know you’re meant for more — but no matter how hard you try, something inside feels off, you’re restless, you’re searching, you’re questioning everything...
That’s not you going crazy. That’s Winter energy kicking in.
It’s the universe pulling you back for a reason — to pause, to reset, to realign, before it hands you your next breakthrough.
And this is the mistake most people make — they resist it. They panic when things slow down. They keep pushing, forcing, grinding — when they should be rebuilding quietly.
But if you listen to that signal… and use this time to rebuild your foundation — your next cycle will take off faster than you’ve ever imagined.
So if you’ve been feeling that shift — that strange pull, that voice telling you, “Something has to change”… don’t ignore it.

And if you miss this window… you’re not just delaying progress — you’re entering your next cycle unprepared.
So yes, you can still do other things. But this? This is your main mission for now.
Always be prepared. Always be aware. Because timing doesn’t wait for people who aren’t paying attention.
And don’t say “I don’t have time.” Everyone has the same 24 hours. The difference is — some move with clarity. Some just move.

Alright, let me make this ultra simple for you. Treat this as a cheatsheet.
👉 One season → One DO → One DON’T. That’s it. simple. But effective.
🌱 If you’re in Grow, DO: launch one bold move. Don’t sit idle and wait for magic.
☀️ If you’re in Harvest, DO: monetize what’s already working, ask for that raise, or push what you’ve built. Don’t go chasing ten new shiny things.
🍂 If you’re in Defend, DO: secure your cash, cut the waste, fix the leaks. Don’t recklessly expand or over-commit.
❄️ If you’re in Reset, DO: learn, rebuild, prepare quietly. Don’t force big risky launches now — it’ll just drain you.
When you keep it this simple, you stop wasting years.You’ll always know exactly what to focus on — and what to avoid.


Your Window Is Opening Soon (Or Already Did)
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Let me tell you something I’ve seen in every chart I’ve decoded — Most people only get 2… maybe 3 real Wealth Windows in their entire lifetime.”
“These are the windows where your timing, your energy, and your opportunity actually align. Where your chart says: ‘Now is the time to move.’”
“But if you miss it? You don’t just miss income. You lose 10 years of your life to the wrong path. The wrong people. The wrong timing.”
“And here’s what hit me the hardest…”
How many 10-year cycles do we really have in one life? - say cantonese > 人生有多少个10年? Maybe 7 or 8 — if we’re lucky. How many of those are true Wealth Cycles? Just 2 or 3.
“So when that window opens — it’s not random. It’s not hype. It’s your once-in-a-decade moment.”
…(short pause)
“You can always work harder later. But you can’t rewind timing.”
If you knew your wealth window is opening now… would you wait? Or would you move — while the door is open?”
“If you feel your timing is now — type ‘NOW’ in the chat. Let me know. Let the universe know.”
“Let’s see who’s ready to stop guessing… and start moving with precision.”

Now, I know what some of you are already thinking… ‘Okay Cae, I know my 10-year season. But what about this year and next year? What should i do? Should I push harder, or should I hold back? Whats my direction?’
That’s exactly why I created the Design your destiny program. Because your annual timing can tilt the intensity — and in a private session, I’ll show you both your season and your yearly weather, so you always know when to accelerate and when to play safe.”

🟡 Now let’s talk about the real reason you’re here...
You don’t just want “motivation.” You want clarity. You want precision. And most importantly — you want a strategic mind who can decode your chart and turn it into real business moves.
That’s exactly what this Founder Boardroom™ 1-on-1 Session is built for.
It’s just you and me — sitting down privately to deep-dive your chart across all 12 business & life palaces.
We’ll zoom in on: ✅ Your true wealth direction ✅ Your personal business cycle — when to scale, when to pause ✅ And what’s really blocking your next-level growth
You’ll walk away with a clear CEO gameplan: 🔹 Where your money flow is stuck 🔹 What exact move to make next 🔹 When to launch, hire, pivot — with no more guessing
⚠️ This isn’t a generic reading. It’s a custom strategy session based on your actual timing, your business, and your season — so you finally stop making expensive decisions at the wrong time.
________________________________
"Let’s start with the first piece of the system — your Wealth Code DNA Blueprint.
If you’ve ever asked yourself:
“Why am I still stuck even though I work so hard?”
“Which business model actually suits me?”
“Am I scaling in the right direction?”
This will answer it — fast.
Because what I’ve seen working with founders across industries is this:
Most people are building their business in the wrong way — not because they’re not smart, but because they don’t know what their natural path is.
This blueprint will show you:
✅ What kind of business model fits you best — no more copying others and hoping it works.
✅ How you naturally create results — whether that’s by being the face, building systems, licensing your IP, or scaling a product.
✅ What path gives you the highest return — based on your real chart, not another strategy template.
So if you’ve been stuck between multiple directions… If you’re scaling but it’s starting to burn you out… Or if you’ve made good money, but don’t know what to double down on next —
This blueprint gives you clarity.
And when you have clarity, momentum comes back."

Now let’s go deeper into two of the most powerful pieces inside the Founder Timing Decision System™.
These are the tools that help my clients — from startup founders to multi-7-figure entrepreneurs — finally stop second-guessing, and start making confident, profitable moves.
🔮 Offer #2: Wealth Timing Cycle
“What season are you in right now — and are you moving in sync with it?”
Let me tell you this — most business owners don’t fail because of bad ideas. They fail because of bad timing.
They scale during a down cycle. They launch right before a crash. They force growth when they’re meant to pause.
That’s why this part of the system exists.
With the Wealth Timing Cycle, you’ll discover:
✅ Which season you’re in right now — Spring, Summer, Autumn or Winter ✅ What business moves are safe or risky based on your current cycle ✅ When to scale, when to pause, when to shift — without burning cash or energy
One client realised she was pushing hard to launch in Winter — no wonder everything felt stuck. Once she aligned to her Summer cycle — profit 4X’d in 3 months. Same product. Just different timing.
This isn’t theory. It’s pattern-backed, chart-aligned, and results-driven.

📆 Offer #3: High-Performing Business Calendar
“Okay, Cae… but what do I actually do next?”
That’s the #1 question I get.
And here’s my answer:
Imagine if someone gave you a 90-day CEO calendar — already pre-filled with your highest-impact business moves.
❌ No more blank pages ❌ No more “What do I do now?” ✅ Just clear execution steps based on your personal chart and season
Inside the High-Performing Business Calendar, you’ll get:
✅ Your top 3 business priorities for the next 90 days ✅ Exact weeks to launch, pause, or pivot ✅ A rhythm that keeps your growth sustainable — without the burnout
One client said, “This calendar saved me from launching too early and helped me prep 3x faster.”
This is not a generic to-do list. It’s built based on your personal chart, your energy cycle, and your wealth season.
Because the best founders don’t just hustle hard — They move smart, with timing on their side.

So if you're already feeling the momentum from these last 2 days…
Just imagine what happens when your calendar, hiring, and decisions are finally synced with your timing.
That's the kind of clarity most CEOs never get access to. But if you're here, listening… you're not most CEOs.
And that’s why this system was built — To help people like you grow with precision, not pressure.
Now some of you might be thinking…
“Okay, I know my season. I know what to focus on in the next 90 days. But what about my team? What about all the people I’m leading — or trying to replace myself with?”
Let’s be honest…
You can’t scale alone. But the wrong team can burn what you’ve built faster than the market ever will.
That’s why the next part of your Founder Timing Decision System™ is all about people and profit.
Let’s go.

Inside this matrix, I’ll show you:
✅ Exactly who supports your zone of genius — and who secretly drains it ✅ What roles to hire, pause, or remove — based on your timing ✅ How to shift from doing the work to leading the right people
This is the tool I’ve used to help 6–8 figure founders restructure their org chart, fire fast, and finally lead without firefighting.
Because the wrong hire doesn’t just cost you payroll. It costs you peace.

🔹 OFFER 5: Scalable Income Blueprint
And let’s talk money.
If you’re here — you’re not the type to rely on just one income stream.
But the challenge is:
“Which income path actually fits my energy and model right now?”
Some of you have: – Tried launching new offers but felt drained – Thought about building brand or IP but second-guessed it – Invested in something… and wondered if it was too early (or too late)
This blueprint helps you:
✅ Identify your natural wealth vehicle — brand, assets, equity, IP, influence ✅ Align your next offer or investment to your actual wealth season ✅ Stack side income without splitting your focus or killing your main business
This is how my clients expand without burnout.
Because income isn’t just about doing more. It’s about doing the right thing — at the right time.

🔚 TRANSITION CLOSE:
So if you’ve ever felt like:
“I’ve done everything right — but the results don’t match the effort…”
This is why.
You’ve had the pieces. But not the system that tells you: — What to focus — Who to build with — When to make your next move
And that’s what the Founder Timing Decision System™ is designed to do.
📌 It doesn’t just give you clarity. 📌 It gives you your next best move.

52 Year Old
Accountant
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Let me share a quick story. This is Aunty Mei — she’s 52. Been doing Accountant for the past 20 years.
She used to try different things to grow her money… invest here a bit, follow what friends say… but always no clear direction.
After she joined the session and learned how to read her own Zi Wei chart — with the app and tools — she realised her strength is in long-term, stable income.
So she focused on one rental property… and helped her sister’s business at the right timing.
6 months later — that one property brought her over half a million in returns. And the business finally became stable.
She told me, “I’m 52, and for the first time, I feel clear and confident in what I’m doing.”
And I want you to hear this part clearly: That’s the power of clarity. That’s the power of alignment. And that’s what happens when you stop guessing, and start moving with your real chart.
Some of you here… you’re just one decision away from that same clarity.”

The Same High-Level Strategy Used by Millionaires to Make Aligned Moves(Now in Your Hands, Customized to Your Chart)
Founder Timing Decision System™
2 bucks a day, to finally know exactly when to move, what your chart is telling you, and how to build income aligned to you.
And here’s the crazy part: This exact strategy? It’s what many millionaires are already using — just behind the scenes. The difference is… you’re finally learning how to use it for yourself. This isn’t wishful thinking. It’s how the top 1% make aligned moves without second-guessing.
So now, ask yourself this: Would you trade 2 bucks a day to stop living in doubt, and start moving with clarity?
Because that’s what this really is.Clarity, timing, and income — all decoded.


If your goal is to make $1 million this year, then $997 is only 0.0997% of the investment.
Founder Timing Decision System™
If your goal is to make one million dollars this year… then 997 dollars is only 0.0997% of that goal.
Let that sink in.
You’re not deciding whether to spend 997. You’re deciding whether you’re willing to invest less than 0.1% to unlock the path to the other 99.9%.
This is not an expense. This is positioning.
Because people who think small will say, ‘997 is expensive.’
But people who think in millions ask a different question: ‘Is 0.0997% worth clarity, speed, and fewer mistakes?’
If I told you there’s a door that leads to your million, and the key to open it costs less than one-tenth of one percent… you wouldn’t negotiate. You’d reach for it.
This decision is not about money. It’s about identity.
Are you someone who protects small amounts, or someone who builds big outcomes?
You don’t make a million by being careful with 997. You make a million by being decisive with leverage.
And tonight, this 997… is your leverage

That’s why I created a simple promise.
If you follow the system, and you don’t make back your investment within 12 months, we won’t leave you hanging. We’ll continue to guide you, and you can rejoin our revision classes again and again — until you do.
And let me be upfront: this isn’t free for us either. Every time we run a workshop like this, we have an event team behind the scenes — preparing your materials, running the software, managing & handling the tech, answering questions, making sure everything flows. It takes real time, energy, and cost to hold this events.
So when I say the risk is on us, I mean it. We’re covering all that for you.
Because I know this works. I’ve seen it work for thousands of people already.The only question is: will you let us guide you through your cycle, or will you keep trying to guess it on your own?” the choice is yours.




Once you step out from the 1-on-1 Consultation, you know exactly what to do step-by-step for your next 3 years — no more confusion, no more wasted detours.
So you don’t fall into that same painful loop of “I wish I started sooner...” “I should’ve trusted my gut back then...” “I knew I needed this — but I hesitated.”

[BEFORE VIDEO]“We’ve talked about decisions, direction, and timing... But there’s still one thing most people never think about — until it’s too late.”
“This next 2 minutes... Might completely shift how you see your life.”
“Just watch.”
[AFTER VIDEO]
“Let me ask you this… After watching that — what hit you the most?”
Drop it in the comments.
Was it the time spent working? Scrolling phone? Or just doing things that don’t really matter?
You can type in the chat — just one thing. Something that made you think, ‘I don’t want to waste the next 10 years like that.’
Because thinking about it is one thing… But changing something — that starts now.
***Alright, now I wanna take this chance to Congrats to those of you who sign up, I saw some of your text, awesome!” I love seeing people who don’t just sit and think about it, but actually take action. That’s the exact kind of energy that creates results.
And I know for a fact, a year from now, you’re going to look back and be so glad you said yes today.



If Not Now, Then When?
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Now guys, Let’s be real for a second.
You already know this is something you need. You’ve been thinking about it… Maybe even telling yourself things like:
‘I’ll do it later.’ ‘I just need to make more money first.’ ‘I’m not sure if now’s the right time.’
But let me ask you honestly — When is it ever the right time?
When your calendar magically clears up? When life stops being chaotic? When all your problems solve themselves?
Let’s be real — that’s not how life works. And deep down… you already know that. In fact, you’ve been living in this life for too long. 
And let’s talk about that line: ‘I need to make more money first.’
That’s like saying: ‘I’ll join the gym after I lose weight, after i get fit first.’ It doesn’t make sense. You go to the gym to get fit, you go to the gym to get healthy. Just like you come to this session to finally align your time, energy, and money — so you stop leaking it in the wrong direction.
You know that if you don’t make a move now, 3 months from now — you’ll still be here. Still thinking about it. Still overanalyzing. Still stuck.
That’s how people stay in loops. Not because they’re not capable. But because they keep waiting for permission.
So here’s the truth:
If not now — then when? If not this — what? And if not you — who?
This is the moment. Not next week. Not when things are ‘less busy.’
Right now — while the window’s still open.”


Q&A
Founder Timing Decision System™
You know what’s one of the most expensive things in the world? Tax.
I pay mine every year on time… I don’t know about you lah — maybe you “see first, see first”… 👀🤣
And the best part? Whether you like it or not, you’re paying it every single year until you die. It’s literally the longest relationship you will ever have.
BUT here’s the good news: If you’re in Malaysia… your education expenses are CLAIMABLE for income tax. Yes — the government is basically saying, “Please go upgrade yourself, we sponsor a bit.”
So honestly… I don’t know what you’re still thinking about. Not signing up? Waiting for LHDN to give you a personal invitation ah? 😌🔥


Worksheet of Day-2
(90-Day Timing Card)
Founder Timing Decision System™
Before we wrap up tonight, I want you to download this. This is your 90-Day Timing Card.
It’s very simple to complete, when you finish it, you’ll have your season, your one right move, your trap to avoid, and the proof you’ll use to check if it’s working.
Think of it as your personal 90-day timing plan.
Now, scan the QR code — you’ll get the worksheet instantly. Finish it in before you sleep tonight, and send it back to our team on WhatsApp.
Here’s the key: don’t overthink. Write it down, even if it feels rough.
And here’s the truth — if your answers feel vague, that’s normal. Most people are still guessing. That’s why in our 1-on-1 consultation, I sit with you, check your chart, map your yearly windows, and turn that vague card into a step-by-step plan that actually moves you forward.
So do this tonight. In fact, Many of our existing students told us — just by filling this page, they sleep better that night, because finally they know what their next 90 days should look like.


Day 1 → DNA = Your Lane

Day 2 → Season = Your Timing (DO + DON’T + One Move)
🌱☀️🍂❄️☀️🌧️🌩️
Founder Timing Decision System™
“Now before we end, Let’s zoom out for a second.
👉 On Day 1, you discovered your DNA — your lane. For the first time, you could see why certain paths felt so tiring, and why others felt natural. The old belief was: ‘I just need to hustle harder.’ But the new belief is: ‘Wealth comes when my lane matches my DNA.’ That’s clarity.
👉 Then today, Day 2, you discovered your season — your timing. This is why some years you felt like flying, and some years you felt like dragging a rock uphill. You saw that one season only needs one DO, one DON’T, and one clear move. The old belief was: ‘If I keep pushing, I’ll break through.’ The new belief is: ‘Right move in the wrong season = pain. Right move in the right season = profit.’ That’s power.
👉 And on top of that, we touched on annual weather — the reason some years felt smoother or heavier inside the same cycle. And that’s something I can map with you in a 1-on-1, because everyone’s yearly windows are different.
So think about what this means.
Day 1 gave you clarity.Day 2 gave you timing.And tomorrow, Day 3, I’m going to show you how to put it together into an activation roadmap — the exact way to use your DNA and your timing to finally move in sync and alignment.
Because knowing your lane and your season is powerful… but combining them? That’s when breakthroughs happen.

ACTIVATE YOUR WEALTH POTENTIAL
DAY 3
So today, we’re gonna show you how to activate your wealth potential

Knowing ≠ Doing
Think about it — if knowing was enough, everyone here would already be living their dream life. We all know we should manage money better… We all know we should rest more, think smarter, invest wiser… But most people still get stuck. why? Not because they don’t know what to do — but because something inside them isn’t activated.
That’s the difference between “learning a strategy” and living it.


What does “Activation” mean to you?
Before we go deeper, I want to ask you something.
When you hear the word “Activation,” what comes to your mind? Don’t overthink — just type your answer in the chat right now.
When I say “Activate your wealth” or “Activate your destiny,” what do you feel it means?
(look at chat)
Okay, I see some great ones — “take action,” “be consistent,” “motivation,” “push harder.”
Nice. Those are all good answers.
But think about this — if activation only means “taking action,” then why are there so many people working hard every single day, pushing themselves, learning new skills… yet still stuck in the same place?
They’re not lazy. They’re not lost. But somehow, the results just don’t move.
Here’s what I’ve learned after reading thousands of charts — Activation isn’t about doing more. It’s about how fast you do it. 
Because true activation is when - your path, your timing, and your actions all click into the right rhythm.
What does “the right rhythm” even means?
It means you start moving in tune with your season. You speed up when momentum builds, and you pivot when the energy shifts. You’re not stopping — you’re just playing the rhythm smarter.
When your rhythm matches your timing, everything syncs.
You DO the right thing at the right time. You meet the right person without chasing. You make one move — and ten things align behind it.
That’s what “the right rhythm” feels like.
And when that happens — the same effort that used to feel heavy now feels light.
Things that used to drag suddenly accelerate. Opportunities appear faster. People say yes quicker.
And then it hits you — it was never about luck. It was about rhythm. It was about alignment.
That’s what Activation truly is.
If you’ve ever had that one season in life where everything just clicked, where everything flowed and success felt natural — type “YES” in the chat right now.
(react to chat)
That feeling — that’s activation. And today, I’m going to show you how to bring that rhythm back on demand, so you stop waiting for “good timing”… and start controlling it.
Ready?


You see, most people love the idea of alignment. They love talking about flow, rhythm, timing — until it’s time to actually move.
Because when it’s time to move, something shows up first — fear.
Fear of failing. Fear of losing. Fear of looking stupid.
So let me give you a scenario to show you how activation really works.
So let’s imagine this…
NASA just announced that a massive rock is heading straight toward Earth. If it hits, that’s it — game over.
But there’s one way to save your life — and your family’s life: you must do public speaking.
You have 24 hours. You need to talk, sell, or everyone you love disappears.
Crazy? Sure. But think about it — if that really happened, would you do it?
Of course, yes.
You wouldn’t say, “I’m not good at speaking.” You wouldn’t say, “I’m shy.” You wouldn’t wait to read one more book about it.
You’d figure it out — immediately. You’d knock doors, call strangers, do whatever it takes — because failure is no longer an option.
That’s what I call activation.
It’s not motivation. It’s survival.
When your brain realises, “If I don’t move, I lose everything,” it stops negotiating and starts producing miracles.
You find energy you didn’t know you had. You find words you never rehearsed. You sell with clarity, because suddenly the reason is bigger than the fear.
That’s the difference.
Why this is important to you today?
You were never afraid of sales — you were afraid of rejection, of judgment, of being seen trying and failing.
But the moment your reason becomes stronger than your fear, that’s when the activation switch flips on.
Most people wait until life forces them to activate — they only move when they have to.
The successful ones? They learn to activate before the rock appears.
That’s why when opportunity shows up — they’re already moving. They don’t need time to prepare. Because they live like that rock is always coming.
That’s the difference between people who just survive… and people who dominate.
Learning how to flip that switch without waiting for the rock.
Because when you can activate that level of urgency by choice, you no longer need pressure to perform.
You move with precision. You act on rhythm. You make progress that feels unstoppable.
And that’s exactly what I’m going to show you next —
how to trigger that switch on demand,
using your Season, your Switch, and your One Move.


If I could show you the exact switch that takes you from starting to actually finishing… would you want to see it?
Founder Timing Decision System™
Now let me ask you something real quick… If I could show you the exact switch that takes you from just starting… to actually finishing… How many of you would like to see it?Type ‘YES’ in the chat right now if you want that switch.” [Pause, react to chat: “Wow, look at all the YES’s coming in.”]
“Perfect — because that’s exactly what you’re going to discover tonight.”

EXCLUSIVE BONUS
NEW
In fact, chances are that you’re gonna get today’s fast action - time limited bonus and you actually gonna find this even more valuable than the bonuses we shared yesterday. 
In my opinion, this fast action bonus today is even more crazy than yesterday. You can be the judge when i show you to it later today
So i decided to go overboard with the bonus of today.
This particular bonus im gonna reveal later on, has been the catalyst behind countless wealth breakthroughs — from students doubling their income within a single season, to business owners unlocking 7-figure growth windows they didn’t even know existed. And up till now, it’s only been made available to our high-level clients who invested significantly to work with us.. And this bonus is something we only make it available for the people who already sign up yesterday , as well as people who’s gonna sign up Design Your Destiny today before the end of this bootcamp.
So stay sharp. And also at the end we gonna have a Q&A session dedicated for you as well.


Now, I want to take you back to how we ended last night. Remember that jellybean video? Each bean representing one day of your life… and by the end, you realise — there’s actually not that many left for the things that truly matter.
And that’s exactly why I created this system. Not just to show you charts or stars… but to give you a strategy for your time — so every step you take, every decision you make, actually compounds toward something that lasts.
Let me give you an example. One of my clients, Jason — very hardworking guy, very passionate. But for five years, he kept starting over — new job, new side hustle, new project, new circles — every time thinking “this could be it.” But at the end nothing really clicked. So when we looked into his chart, his timing was totally off. He was sprinting in his setup years instead of his harvest years.
Once he understood his season, it was like flipping a switch. He didn’t need more motivation, rather he needed the right move. And within four months, things just started flowing — the same effort, but multiplied results.
And that’s what this is about. Because sometimes… it’s not that you’re not talented, in fact many of you, you’re super talented and you’ve got multiple skills. It’s just that you’ve been planting the wrong seeds in winter.
So when your timing aligns — that’s when everything starts making sense. Your energy returns. Your direction sharpens. You stop second-guessing every move.
And that’s what today is about — activation. Taking everything you’ve discovered in the past two days, and turning it into a clear, timed action plan that fits your season.
Because here’s the truth — clarity without activation changes nothing. But once you activate at the right time, you move with power, not pressure.
That’s why, by the end of today, I’m going to show you exactly how to map your next 90 days — step by step — so you can finally move from knowing your chart to living it.
So if you’re ready to stop guessing, and start turning your season into results… Type YES in the chat.


Clarity Alone Is Enough?
Knowing your DNA & Season ≠ Done
Now before we dive in, let me ask you a question… Why is it that some people can know their chart inside out — they know their DNA, they know their Season — and still stay stuck?
Think about it. You’ve probably seen it too. Someone attends courses, takes notes, says they’re very clear… but half a year later, nothing much has changed.
Why? It’s because of these very common traps people fall into.
The first trap is believing clarity by itself is enough. ‘I know my DNA I know my stars, I know my Season, I’m clear.’
But clarity alone doesn’t create movement. What do i mean by that? It’s like sitting in your car with the GPS on — the route is clear, the lane is marked, the light is green… But if you don’t start the engine, the car still doesn’t move, right?
So clarity is powerful, but without Activation, it’s just theory.



Waiting to be ready?
Knowing your DNA & Season ≠ Done
Now, the second trap people fall into is this: waiting until they feel ‘ready.’ ‘I’ll do it later… when the timing is perfect… when I have more money… when life is more stable.’ 
But let me ask you — when you start your own business, or your own job,  were you 100% ready? Fully confident? Were you skillful that time? Trained for everything?
Of course not. You just jumped in, learned on the spot, figured things out as you went.
👉 How many of you start your business or got your first job before you ever felt ‘ready’? Type YES if that’s true for you.” [Pause, look at chat: “Wow, look at all the YES’s… exactly.”]
“And that’s the point — the best opportunities in life almost never arrive at the perfect moment.
I had a client who kept saying, ‘Cae, I’ll invest in my business when I’m more stable.’ Every year, something new came up — the economy, family, health. The timing never felt perfect. And guess what? She stayed stuck for five years.
Meanwhile, her friend — who had half the resources — decided to act in her Grow Season. Within two years, she doubled her income.
👉 So remember this: timing creates the window. But if you keep waiting for the perfect moment? That window closes on you.
The truth is — you’ll never feel fully ready. You have to flip the switch anyway.”


Result = DNA × Season × Activation
10 x 10 x 0 = 0
10 x 0 x 10 = 0 
0 x 10 x 10 = 0
Now let me show you something simple but powerful. The Wealth Code works like an equation:
👉 Result = DNA × Season × Activation.
Why multiplication, not addition? Because if any one of them is zero… the whole result is zero.
Let me give you examples.
Say your DNA is strong = 10. Your Season is perfect = 10. But your Activation is missing = 0. 10 × 10 × 0 = 0. Result? Zero.
Or maybe you’re taking massive action, Activation = 10. You know yourself well, DNA = 10. But timing is off, Season = 0. 10 × 0 × 10 = 0. Result? Zero again.
Or maybe timing is right, Activation is strong… But you’re in the wrong lane, wrong DNA alignment = 0. 0 × 10 × 10 = 0. Still zero.
👉 Do you see it now? Knowing yourself alone won’t save you. Waiting for timing alone won’t save you. Taking action alone won’t save you.
But when all three align? 10 × 10 × 10 = 1,000. That’s when results multiply.”
[Pause, smile] “Type YES if you can see how missing even one part is exactly why people stay stuck.”
This is why you don’t guess your destiny, you dont guess your future. Purple star astrology is all about maths.

4 Wealth 
Activation:
= LU, QUAN, KE, JI

Founder Timing Decision System™
⚡️ LU = Wealth & Opportunity Flow
You’ve already seen your chart — that’s your DNA. You’ve learned your timing — your season.
Now let’s talk about what that really means for your money flow.
In Zi Wei, we call it Lu (祿) — you can think of it like your money magnet. When it’s on, the right people show up, deals come easier, and things just… flow smoother.
When your Lu activates at the right season and you take action — it’s like turning on a water tap that’s been waiting. Money flows, opportunities open, and even small things suddenly bring big results.
But here’s the truth — Yes, maybe you have a good chart, good stars… but so what? If you never use it, never act on it, never move — you’re basically leaving gold buried in the ground.
Imagine standing on a land full of gold. You already own the resources. But if you never dig, or you dig it out and leave it there — you’re wasting your own luck.
That’s why two people can have almost the same chart, same effort, same skill… but one gets rich, one stays stuck.
It’s not luck. It’s activation timing.
Wealth isn’t just about what you should do — that’s Level 1.
The true activation is how fast you do it?
A lot of people out there sell the same thing as you, know the same stuff as you — so why do people buy from them? Because when their Lu opened, they moved. When yours opened, you hesitated.
When your path and timing match — your effort multiplies. When they clash — your energy disappears.
Most people only fix the outside: marketing, strategy, skillset... But if you’re doing all that in your dry season, it’s like watering frozen soil — nothing grows.
So the real question is — how do you know when your Lu is open, and how do you move before that window closes?
Let’s decode that next.


💰 Lu = Wealth & Opportunity Flow
Right Activation → money pours. 
Wrong Activation → dry tap, effort wasted.
Founder Timing Decision System™
💰 Lu = Wealth 
 how do you know when your Lu is open, and how do you move before that window closes?


Before: Extra hours. Tried new hustle. No results.
After: Opened new stream. +$30k in 4 months.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #1: 
Lu + Spring Season 
Let’s talk about Lu in the Spring Season.
This is one of the best combinations you can get — because Lu represents growth, support, and opportunities opening up, and Spring is the season of new beginnings.
So when these two energies meet, it’s like the universe saying, “Hey — it’s time to plant new seeds. You’re supported.”
I had a client going through this exact phase. She told me,
“Cae, I’ve been putting in extra hours, tried different hustles, but nothing’s working.”
And I said,
“That’s because you’ve been repeating old energy. This season isn’t about fixing the past — it’s about launching the new.”
So we looked at her chart — Lu was active, and deep inside her Career Palace, two strong stars showed up: Wu Qu and Tan Lang.
Wu Qu gave her the discipline and structure to build something solid. Tan Lang gave her the charisma and magnetism to attract opportunities fast.
We built one new offer based on that combo — clear system + strong personal branding. And in just four months, she opened a new income stream and made an extra RM30,000 — doing less, but moving with timing.

That’s the power of Lu + Spring. When the stars open, you don’t wait — you start planting.  And when Wu Qu drives your execution and Tan Lang amplifies your attraction, results come faster than effort.



Before: Boss kept launching new offers, overworked, profit stuck.
After: Leveraged existing clients + assets, profit up 40% in 3 months.”
Founder Timing Decision System™
 Scenario #2: 
Lu + Summer Season 
Let’s talk about Lu in the Summer Season.
Summer sounds exciting — hot energy, strong momentum — but it’s actually a leverage season, not an expansion one. You’re supposed to maximize what you already have, not keep starting new things.
But when Lu shows up, it gives you that money rush — you’ll feel like, “Let’s launch more! Hire more! Do more!” That’s the trap — you end up busier, but not richer.

One business owner told me,
“Cae, I keep launching new offers and running more ads, but profit still stuck.”
I said,
“Because Summer Lu isn’t about new money — it’s about amplifying the money you already have.”
So we stopped creating new products. Instead, we focused on what’s already working — upsold loyal clients, improved his referral system, and reactivated old leads.

In just 3 months, he didn’t add anything new — but profit jumped 35%, and he finally got his weekends back.

That’s Lu + Summer: you don’t need to do more. You just need to do smarter. Leverage what’s around you — that’s how real wealth grows in this season.




Before: Burnout at work, unsure if it’s time to change.
After: Planned transition, new company +25% pay, smooth upgrade.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #3: 
Lu + Autumn Season 
Let’s talk about Lu in the Autumn Season.
Autumn is the season of harvest and refinement — it’s when you review what you’ve built, and decide what’s worth keeping or changing.
But when Lu appears here, you’ll suddenly feel that itch — the urge to start something new, change direction, switch industries, invest in other business, or explore a side income. It’s not random — it’s your chart saying, “Your old growth cycle is ending. It’s time to evolve.”

I had one SG client — a senior manager. Lu was active, Autumn energy strong. She told me,
“Cae, I’m comfortable where I am… but lately I keep thinking about changing roles or even industries. I don’t know if it’s right timing or just me being restless.”
I told her,
“That’s normal for Lu in Autumn. The energy pushes you to refresh your direction, but it doesn’t mean you must quit tomorrow. You just need to plan the transition properly.”

So we mapped her Career Palace timing, identified the next 6-month window of strong luck, and used this period to upgrade her skillset and network.
By the time that window opened, she moved to a new company with better culture and a 25% salary increase — zero burnout, zero regret.

That’s the lesson of Lu + Autumn. When the urge to move hits, don’t fight it — but don’t rush it either. Use the in-between season to refine, upgrade, and prepare.
Because when your new cycle starts, you’ll already be one step ahead of everyone still hesitating.


Before: Retired with savings but no clear plan
After: Structured cash flow, started low-stress project, steady income in 6 months.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #4: 
Lu + Winter Season 
Now let’s talk about Lu in the Winter Season.
Winter is not about chasing wealth — it’s about protecting and realigning it. When Lu appears here, the message isn’t “make more money,” it’s “make your money work smarter.”

I had one client — just retired after 30 years in business. He said,
“Cae, I finally have time and savings, but I don’t know what to do next. Should I invest? Start something? Or just rest?”
And I told him —
“You don’t need to hustle anymore. You need to stabilize.”

So instead of rushing into big investments, we went practical: ✅ listed down all his fixed expenses, ✅ calculated his monthly comfort budget, ✅ moved some idle cash into low-risk instruments, ✅ and picked one small, meaningful project he enjoyed — teaching part-time and consulting from home.

Within 6 months, his income became consistent again — not from stress, but from structure. He said,
“For the first time, I’m earning peacefully. I’m not chasing, I’m managing.”

That’s Lu + Winter. It’s about steady wealth, not speed wealth.
If you’re in this phase, your goal isn’t to build empires — it’s to let your money, skills, and experience quietly provide for you.


Founder Timing Decision System™
⚡️ QUAN = CONTROL & POWER ACTIVATION
Many people ask me — “Is life fated?”
Yes — a lot of things are written. From the moment you were born, your chart already gave you a life script.
Some are playing the “rich but suffer” script. Some play the “suffer first, then succeed” script. Some... still replay the same story every year.
But here’s what most people don’t realise — no matter what script you’re born with, you can still decide how you play it.
That’s called Quan Activation.
In Zi Wei, Quan (权) means power and control. It’s your ability to decide, to lead, to take charge of your story — instead of letting others write it for you.
So ask yourself — are you the actor in your life, or the director?
If you’re just following the script blindly, don’t know how to read it, always waiting for something to change — you’re the actor.
But when you start taking charge, you become the director. You still have the same story, but now you decide the angle, the timing, the ending.
That’s what happens when your Quan activates.
When Quan flows in the right season, you become bold, decisive, unstoppable. You speak with clarity, you act with confidence, and people start following your lead.
But when your Quan is off, you overthink, ask ten people for advice, and still don’t move. That’s when life starts controlling you — instead of the other way around.
So remember: Lu brings you opportunities. Quan decides whether you can hold them.
When both activate together — you stop living on autopilot… and start directing your own destiny.
Now lets see how to identify quan activation 



🎖️ Quan = Authority & Power
Right Activation → authority respected. 
Wrong Activation → power struggle, conflict.
Founder Timing Decision System™
🎖️ Quan = Authority 

Before: Stable but playing safe, growth stagnant
After: Expanded team + new vertical, revenue tripled in 5 months.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #5: 
Quan + Spring Season  
Let’s talk about Quan in the Spring Season.
Quan means power, control, expansion. Spring means growth and momentum. So when these two energies meet — that’s your green light to expand your business and influence.
This is the season to scale, to take what you’ve built and push it into bigger territory — new markets, new products, new partnerships.
I had one business owner going through this exact phase. Quan active, Spring energy strong. He said,
“Cae, things finally feel stable… but part of me wants to go bigger — open another branch, build a team — I just don’t know if it’s the right time.”
And I told him,
“If your Quan meets Spring, that is the signal. This is not the time to play safe. It’s time to use your power to multiply.”

So we mapped out his Wealth Palace and Career Palace flow, aligned his chart timing, and expanded strategically — he hired two new key managers, streamlined operations, and launched a new product vertical.
Within 5 months, his revenue tripled, and he finally had time to focus on vision, not firefighting.

That’s Quan + Spring — power meets growth.
If you’re in this season, don’t hold back. Use your leadership, your network, and your timing to expand what’s already working.
Because this is the cycle where your decisions can multiply results for years ahead.



Before: Leading quietly, overworked, unappreciated. 
After: Built visibility, promoted to department head in 6 months.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #6: 
Quan + Summer Season  
Let’s talk about Quan in the Summer Season.
Quan means power, control, and authority. And Summer is the season of leverage and visibility. So when these two energies combine, it’s your time to step up and take charge.
But here’s the key — this isn’t about working harder. It’s about learning to influence through structure, and lead through leverage.

I had one client going through this exact cycle. Middle management — great performer, but always behind the scenes. She said,
“Cae, I’m exhausted. I’m leading so many projects, but it feels like no one sees my effort.”
And I told her,
“That’s Quan in Summer. You already have power — you just haven’t leverage it publicly. This season isn’t about doing more — it’s about being seen leading.”

So we refined her communication style, helped her start sharing her wins openly, and taught her how to delegate instead of micromanage.
Within 6 months, her directors started noticing her results, she got promoted to department head, and even became the internal trainer for new leaders.

That’s Quan + Summer — the season to go from invisible to influential.
So if you’re in this phase, stop hiding behind execution. Speak up, claim credit, build visibility. You don’t need to prove your power anymore — you just need to own it.


Before: Team bloated, effort scattered, heavy to lead.
After: Fire underperforming staff, profit gained back again
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #7: 
Quan + Autumn Season  
Let’s talk about Quan in the Autumn Season.
Quan means power, authority, and decisions. Autumn is the defend and cut season — it’s when you consolidate, clean up, and protect what you’ve built.
So when Quan appears in Autumn, this is the time to use your power to make hard decisions. If you’re a business owner, that means one thing — it’s time to trim the fat.

I had one client in this exact phase. His company had grown fast during Spring and Summer, but by Autumn, profits started shrinking. He said,
“Cae, I don’t get it — the business looks busy, but margins are thinner than ever.”
I looked at his chart — Quan strong, Autumn energy active. I told him,
“This is your clean-up cycle. You don’t need more people — you need the right people. Time to defend your business, even if it means letting some go.”

So we reviewed his team. He identified 3 non-performers, a few “nice but not effective” hires, and restructured his workflow. It wasn’t easy — he had to let go of two long-term staff. But within 2 months, his profit margin rebounded 30%, and the whole company ran smoother than ever.

That’s Quan + Autumn — the season of power through pruning.
If you’re in this phase, don’t be afraid to cut what no longer supports your growth — whether that’s people, projects, or partnerships.
Because sometimes, real leadership isn’t about adding more — it’s about having the courage to defend what matters and release what doesn’t.


Before: Stable but stagnant, no growth direction.
After: Upgraded skill set, became top candidate for next promotion.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #8: 
Quan + Winter Season  
Let’s talk about Quan in the Winter Season.
Quan means power and authority. Winter means reset and reflection. So when these two energies meet, it’s not about climbing yet — it’s about rebuilding your power from within.

I had one client — mid-level manager, Quan active, Winter energy strong. She said,
“Cae, things at work are stable, but I feel like I’ve hit a ceiling. I’m not growing, but I also don’t know what’s next.”
And I told her,
“You’re not lost — you’re in a reset cycle. This isn’t the time to chase a title — it’s the time to upgrade your capability so the next door can open.”

So she used this period wisely — took an advanced management course, improved her communication and leadership presence, and quietly built a track record of results.
Within a few months, her bosses noticed. When a new division lead role opened up, she was the first name shortlisted — because her skills already matched the next level.

That’s Quan + Winter — the season of silent preparation that leads to visible power.
If you’re in this phase, don’t rush to “climb.” Focus on strengthening your value, because this is how you set up your next major promotion window.


✨ Ke = Recognition & Fame
Right Activation → recognition multiplies 
Wrong Activation → low exposure & misunderstood
Founder Timing Decision System™
✨ Ke = Spotlight  

Before: Worked hard quietly, no recognition. After: Gained visibility + award, recognized by leaders within 3 months.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #9:     Ke + Spring Season
Let’s talk about Ke in the Spring Season.
Ke represents fame, recognition, and noble help — people start noticing your effort, and opportunities flow more smoothly.
And Spring? It’s the growth season — the time when your energy expands, new projects bloom, and people finally see your potential.
So when Ke appears in Spring, it’s the perfect combination for being seen and celebrated.

I had one client — working in an MNC. For years, her work was solid, but nobody noticed. Then her Ke + Spring cycle kicked in. Suddenly, her projects started gaining attention, managers began looping her into bigger meetings, and she got nominated for an internal award she never even applied for.

I told her,
“This is your time to be visible. You’ve already done the groundwork — now it’s time to show it.”
So she started sharing results publicly, took on presentation roles, and said yes to a cross-department project.
Within 3 months, her name was on the regional performance list, and she got invited to speak at the annual conference.

That’s Ke + Spring — recognition meets growth.
If you’re in sales, MLM, or corporate, this is the season to step up and be seen. Say yes to visibility, because noble people and opportunities are already lining up to open your next door.


Before: Kept hustling alone, growth slow
After: Reconnected with nobleman network, landed 6-figure deal
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #10:   Ke + Summer Season
Let’s talk about Ke in the Summer Season.
Ke represents fame, recognition, and nobleman support — people who genuinely help you rise. And Summer is the harvest season — the time to reap what you’ve built, and let others help you multiply it.
When these two energies meet, your opportunities won’t come from hustle — they’ll come from people.

I had one client — a business consultant. Ke active, Summer energy strong. She said,
“Cae, I’ve been working non-stop, but this time, projects just flow in easily. I didn’t even have to chase — people keep referring me.”
That’s Ke in Summer energy at work. You attract help, collaborations, introductions — all from people who see your value.

So if you’re in this cycle, this is not the time to do everything alone. It’s the time to leverage your nobleman network. Ask yourself: Who has truly helped you? Who opened doors for you, gave advice, or connected you to opportunities? And more importantly — have you nurtured those relationships?
Because in Summer, your wealth and recognition grow fastest through teamwork, partnerships, and gratitude.

I told my client,
“Instead of finding more clients, focus on the people who already believe in you.”
She did that — and within two months, one of her old contacts introduced her to a regional deal worth six figures.

That’s Ke + Summer — fame and success through people.
So if you’re in this phase, don’t just work harder. Work with people who elevate you. Because sometimes, your next breakthrough is already sitting in your contact list.


Before: Busy with 10 things, all half-ass results.
After: Focused on one right move, progress smooth, clarity regained.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #11:   Ke + Autumn Season
Let’s talk about Ke in the Autumn Season.
Ke means fame, recognition, and smooth progress. Autumn means defend and cut. So when these two meet — the message is simple: if you want things to be smooth, you must focus and refine.

I had one client — super driven, doing ten different things at once: side business, new project, extra collaborations. She told me,
“Cae, I’m busy every day, but nothing seems to move forward.”
And I said,
“That’s Ke in Autumn. You can’t expand by scattering your energy. Because if those 10 things are in the wrong direction, you’re just doing 10 wrong moves faster. One right move beats ten wrong ones — every single time.”

So we simplified her strategy — cut off low-impact tasks, kept one core offer, and realigned her focus.
Within two months, her results became smoother, her visibility increased, and she finally had time to breathe again.

That’s Ke + Autumn — the season of smart focus.
If you’re in this phase, don’t mistake activity for progress. Doing more doesn’t mean moving faster — it just means burning out sooner.
This season, defend your lane. One clear move in the right direction will create more recognition than ten messy ones ever could.


Before: Stable job but restless, tempted to switch.
After: Stayed put, strengthened influence, gained global recognition
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #12:     Ke + Winter Season
Let’s talk about Ke in the Winter Season.
Ke means fame, recognition, nobleman help. But Winter is the reset season — it’s not about chasing new things, it’s about maintaining what’s already working.
When these two energies meet, the message is clear: Don’t overhaul your path — strengthen your position.

I had one client — senior in an MNC, Ke active, Winter energy strong. He said,
“Cae, I feel stuck. Work is stable, income steady… but I’m tempted to jump to another company for excitement.”
And I told him,
“You’re in Ke + Winter. This is not the time to make big moves. Your name is already gaining weight — if you jump now, you reset your credibility to zero.”

So we focused on stability instead: he built stronger ties with his regional HQ, took on a mentorship role, and improved his team’s delivery speed.
Within 4 months, he got nominated for a global leadership exchange program — no job change needed, no risk taken.

That’s Ke + Winter — fame through consistency.
If you’re in this season, don’t chase “new.” Stay where recognition is already building. Polish your craft, deepen your network, and let your results speak. Because your next door will open from the reputation you hold steady now.


Founder Timing Decision System™
⚡️ JI = AWARENESS & RESET ACTIVATION
You’ve learned about Lu — how fast you move. You’ve learned about Quan — how smart you play it. Now let’s talk about the one most people ignore — Ji (忌).
In Zi Wei, Ji is like a warning signal. It tells you where your energy leaks, what patterns keep pulling you back, and what lessons you still haven’t learned.
Most people hate Ji, because it often comes in the form of pain, setback, or loss. But Ji isn’t there to punish you — it’s there to protect you.
If Lu is the accelerator, Ji is the brake. Not meant to stop you forever — but to make sure you don’t crash.
When your Ji activates, you’ll notice things that used to work suddenly stop working. Deals delay, plans change, people pull away — and it feels like the universe is blocking you.
But here’s the truth — it’s not blocking you, it’s redirecting you. It’s telling you: “Slow down. You’re forcing something that’s not aligned anymore.”
And if you ignore that signal, you’ll keep repeating the same mistake — just with a different name, a different year, a different person.
Ji is your awareness point. It’s asking: Do you want to keep pushing blindly? Or will you finally pause, reflect, and reset?
Because sometimes, growth doesn’t come from doing more — it comes from letting go of what’s draining you.
So remember — Lu helps you move fast. Quan helps you move smart. Ke helps you move wisely. But Ji reminds you when to stop, so you don’t break yourself while chasing speed.
That’s why those who understand their Ji — don’t fear obstacles. They use it as data, they adjust their timing, and they rise even stronger in the next cycle.




💧 Ji = Challenges
Right Activation → protection 
Wrong Activation → blockage, lose money
Founder Timing Decision System™
🛡️Ji = Challenges 

Before: Kept starting new things, no results.
After: Stabilized foundation, fixed leaks, ready to grow next season.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #13:       Ji + Spring Season 
Let’s talk about Ji in the Spring Season.
Ji represents insufficiency and challenge. Spring represents growth, new beginnings, expansion.
So when these two meet — you’ll feel that strong urge to start something new. You’ll tell yourself, “It’s time to expand, time to grow.” But your chart says otherwise — this is actually the time to fix before you grow.

I had one business owner exactly like this. He said,
“Cae, I’ve got so many ideas — maybe I’ll open another outlet, or start a new side business. But somehow, I’m also feeling tired and short on cash.”
And I told him,
“That’s Ji in Spring. You’re trying to plant more seeds, when the soil underneath isn’t ready.”

Most people don’t know this — that’s why they keep 冲 (charging ahead) during this cycle. They start new things thinking it’ll bring growth, but because the foundation isn’t fixed, they just end up spreading thinner and losing more money.

So in this season, your job isn’t to create more — it’s to repair and stabilize what’s already built. Look at your cash flow. Look at your team. Look at your processes. Are there leaks? Misalignments? Energy drains?
Because if your structure can’t hold, no new idea will last long.

Once my client stopped chasing expansion and focused on fixing what was already in front of him — he discovered one of his stores had been underperforming quietly for months. He restructured, adjusted the pricing, and within three months, his entire business stabilized.
When Summer arrived, he was finally ready to expand — and this time, every move produced real returns.

That’s Ji + Spring — it’s not about holding back, it’s about fixing forward.
If you’re in this phase, don’t rush to plant new seeds. Stabilize your soil first — your systems, your team, your foundation. Because when the timing truly turns, you won’t need to push — growth will happen naturally.


Before: Said yes to everything, time and money leaking nonstop.
After: Defended smart, cut waste, saved RM50k + 10 hrs/week.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #14:      Ji + Summer Season 
Alright… let’s talk about one of the toughest combos — Ji appearing during your Summer Season.
If you see this in your chart or Da Yun, pay attention — because this is one of those “looks good on paper, but damn tiring” periods.
Ji means challenges and resistance — things don’t flow smoothly, it’s like driving with your brakes half-pressed. And Summer is your defend season — it’s supposed to be about maximizing what you already built in Spring, not starting new things.
But when Ji shows up here, everything jams. You have resources, but can’t activate them. You have a team, but no alignment. You have money, but ROI disappears.

I had one client going through Ji + Summer Da Yun. Corporate job stable, side business doing fine. But she said,
“Cae, I don’t get it. I’m doing everything right — investing, hiring, expanding — but nothing’s moving forward.”
I checked her chart — Ji sitting in the Wealth Palace, Summer energy active. I told her straight,
“This isn’t a growth period. It’s a defense period. Your wealth palace is leaking — you’re trying to fill it by working harder.”

And that’s where most people mess up. They think, “It’s Summer, go big!” But Ji is saying, “Stop. Plug the leaks first.”
So we went line-by-line through her business — cut one unprofitable project, ended a draining partnership, paused expansion for 3 months. She focused on defending — building systems, tightening costs.
In 2 months, she saved RM 50 k and freed up 10 hours a week — and ironically, once she stopped chasing growth, growth finally came.

Because when used right, Ji becomes your firewall. It doesn’t block success — it filters it. It tests if you can manage what you already have before giving you more.
And in Period 9, where “light” exposes everything, this is crucial — any weak foundation will burn fast.

So here’s the lesson: When you’re in Ji + Summer, don’t chase new. Don’t push harder. Defend smarter.
Plug the leaks, strengthen your systems, protect your energy. Because once your firewall stabilizes, the same opportunities that felt “stuck” before will start flowing again.
Just remember — too strong a firewall becomes a wall. Defend… but don’t overprotect.
When you find that balance, Ji stops being your obstacle — and becomes your protector.



Before: Stuck 8 years in same job.
After: Planned exit, landed new role with +20% pay and peace of mind.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #15:     Ji + Autumn  Season 
Autumn is meant to be your harvest season — time to cut the noise, let go, and move forward.
But when Ji shows up here, you can’t cut. You know something’s wrong, but you just can’t let go.
It’s that “cut off, but still emotionally tangled” energy — you end things, yet your heart keeps looping back.

I had a client — Ji sitting in her Spouse Palace, facing the Career Palace. She told me, “Cae, I feel really stuck at work. From the outside everything looks fine — stable job, good team — but deep down, something’s off. I don’t even know why.”
When we dug deeper, we realized… it wasn’t fear of change. It was attachment to feelings — the boss who once helped her, the colleagues she loved, the comfort she didn’t want to lose.

So we mapped her chart, timed the move right, and planned her exit properly. Within 6 weeks, she left peacefully, joined a healthier firm, and that same week — got a 20 % pay bump.

That’s Ji in Autumn. It’s not about being stuck; it’s about learning to end cleanly. Because when you release what’s over, you free your energy for what’s next.



Before: Tried to force growth, tired and unseen.
After: Focused on branding + consistency, accumulated trust, new doors opened next season.
Founder Timing Decision System™
Scenario #16:      Ji + Winter  Season 
Let’s talk about Ji in the Winter Season.
Ji means pressure and limitation. Winter is the reset and accumulate season — it’s not about chasing big moves, but about building quietly and protecting your momentum.

I had one business owner in this phase. He said,
“Cae, things are slowing down… should I push harder or start something new?”
And I told him,
“No. Ji in Winter isn’t asking you to push — it’s asking you to accumulate. Protect what’s working, and slowly build your name and trust.”

So instead of expanding, we focused on 稳中累积 (steady accumulation):
strengthened his service quality,
built customer testimonials,
showed up more consistently on social media,
and shared his brand story quietly online.
No rush, no burnout — just consistent presence. By the time Spring came, his name already carried weight — and new customers came in naturally, without needing heavy marketing.

That’s Ji + Winter — it’s not about speed, it’s about 积累 (accumulation).
If you’re in this season, don’t chase noise or expansion. Focus on branding, consistency, and credibility — because Winter Ji rewards those who protect, polish, and prepare quietly.

Cheatsheet:
Founder Timing Decision System™
Alright, let me make this ultra simple for you. Treat this as a cheatsheet.
👉 One season → One DO → One DON’T. That’s it. simple. But effective.
🌱 If you’re in Grow, DO: launch one bold move. Don’t sit idle and wait for magic.
☀️ If you’re in Harvest, DO: monetize what’s already working, ask for that raise, or push what you’ve built. Don’t go chasing ten new shiny things.
🍂 If you’re in Defend, DO: secure your cash, cut the waste, fix the leaks. Don’t recklessly expand or over-commit.
❄️ If you’re in Reset, DO: learn, rebuild, prepare quietly. Don’t force big risky launches now — it’ll just drain you.
When you keep it this simple, you stop wasting years.You’ll always know exactly what to focus on — and what to avoid.


Ever watched someone take what could’ve been yours?
Founder Timing Decision System™
Let’s be real for a moment.
Who here has ever looked at someone doing exactly what you do… but somehow they’re earning more, getting more attention, and clients just line up for them — even though their service isn’t better, their skills aren’t stronger, and deep down you know… you’re way more capable.
(pause for chat flood — “YES”, “so true”)
It stings, right?
Because it’s not that you didn’t try. It’s that you know you have the potential — but somehow, the spotlight keeps landing on someone else.
You scroll and think, “How is this guy closing deals when his offer so basic?” “How is she booked out when my results are better?”
And the worst part? You were there first. You saw the same opportunity. But you hesitated — maybe you thought it wasn’t the right time, maybe you told yourself, “Next time.”
And then you had to watch them win — with what could have been yours.
That’s one of the most painful feelings in life. Not missing something you never knew about. But watching someone else cash in on the door that was already open for you.
👉 That’s what tonight is about.
Because the truth is — the opportunity didn’t disappear. You just didn’t activate at the right time.
Up next I’ll show you exactly what those switches look like inside your chart — and once you learn how to trigger them, you’ll never have to watch someone “less qualified” win with what should’ve been yours again.

⚔️ Major Cycle Forecast: Sha-Po-Lang Formation
Warrior Trio Structure: Meant for major career/business shifts
Best suited for non-traditional work, flexible or online-based
2022: Started her own business in Dec ✅
2025: Best time to invest assets (car or property) ✅

Founder Timing Decision System™
CASE STUDY 
Alright — let’s talk about a very special type of formation in Zi Wei.
It’s called the Sha-Po-Lang Structure, or what I call the Warrior Trio.
If you have this setup, one thing is guaranteed: Your life will not be “stable” in the traditional sense.
This is the kind of chart that’s meant for big shifts — Changing jobs, pivoting business directions, even flipping your whole lifestyle upside down. And that’s not a bad thing. It just means… you’re not meant for routine.
One of my male clients had this exact formation.
In 2022 — He resigned from his job in September, and by December, he already became a full-time entrepreneur running his own business.
And the chart saw it before it happened.
He always had this feeling that corporate wasn’t for him. But the moment the Sha-Po-Lang formation activated in his 10-year cycle — it pushed him forward.
This formation also favors non-traditional work — like remote business, online sales, project-based income. No fixed office, no fixed boss.
And now in 2025 — his chart shows another powerful shift: High potential for giving birth, starting a family, or entering a major new chapter in life.
That’s what I love about Zi Wei.
It doesn’t just tell you what might happen — It shows you what you're built for. So when your timing opens… you stop doubting and just move.
And if you know you’re going through change now — but you don’t know what it means or where it’s leading…
Then this is exactly what we do inside the Design Your Destiny program. We decode your chart. Your timing. Your real direction. So that you’re no longer guessing — You’re moving with alignment.

Personal Health Warnings
🧠 Major Cycle Forecast – Health Warning
10-Year Health Palace clashed with Natal Health Palace
Forecast: Cancer regarding to breast or reproductive system 
Verified: Breast cancer confirmed in 2022 ✅
Founder Timing Decision System™
CASE STUDY 
Let me show you one real case.
This is one of my female 1on1 client, currently 45. 
I just done consultation with her last week. 
From her chart, i can see that In 2022, she entered a 10-year cycle where their Health Palace clashed head-on with their natal Health Palace.
And what does that usually mean?
In Zi Wei, when your Major Cycle Health clashes with your Natal Health — it's not just a small signal. It’s often a warning of serious illness. Especially related to:
the breast area,
blood circulation, or
the reproductive system.
And true enough — that exact year, 2022 — she was diagnosed with a major health condition.
Now, here's the scary part: That energy doesn’t just disappear after the year ends. Even though the initial event already happened… her current cycle still holds a risk of recurrence.
That’s why when we look at the chart, we’re not here to guess. We’re here to catch the pressure points before they explode again.
Because if you already walked through one storm… the second one is when your body can’t afford to fight blind.
And this is why we created the Design Your Destiny program — so you don’t just know your chart… but you know exactly what part of your life needs attention now — and how to move before it’s too late.
This is not about fear. This is about awareness. And the right action.
If this hit you even a little — I strongly recommend joining our 1-on-1 with Cae, plus the 3-day workshop.
Because knowing your chart is one thing. But knowing how to use it to make better life decisions — that’s where your real power starts.

Wrong Advices from Partner
💰 Major Cycle Forecast – Side Income Crash
10-Year Property Palace clashed with Natal Wealth Palace
Forecast: Indicate big losses from property (> 6 figures)
Verified: Multiple failed attempts despite trying hard on property since 2018  ✅
Founder Timing Decision System™
Let me share another real case — one of my female clients, 59 this year.
She’s someone I really respect. Very hardworking. Never wanted to rely on her husband’s money, even after being a housewife for many years. The moment her kids grew up, she told herself — “I want to do something for myself.”
So she started trying side incomes. Becoming a part time property agent and mlm agent herself.  But no matter how hard she tried, nothing worked. And that confused her. Because she was doing everything people told her to do.
Family said try this. Friends said invest here. She followed. And yet — nothing took off.
When we looked at her chart, it became very clear. She was in a 10-Year Cycle where her Property Palace clashed with her Wealth Palace. This is a classic signal of money stuck, losses, and misalignment. Meaning: no matter how much effort you put in… you’re building in the wrong direction.
And she felt it too. She said: “My mind wants to fight, but my body feels off. Nothing is flowing.” That’s not laziness. That’s a misalignment warning.
I get it. When you’re tired of your full-time job… or thinking about retiring soon… Or when you just don’t want to settle anymore — side income sounds like the first solution.
But here’s the truth: Whether it’s stocks, crypto, property, or business — these are all complicated games. if the timing, direction, or palace isn’t activated… You’ll still fail. No matter how hard you try.
How many of you think… it would’ve saved you so much time if you had a real GPS to guide you earlier? So that you dont have to do any guesswork? Type GPS in the chat
Someone who could tell you:
Where to move,
When to act,
And how to align your energy with the right timing?
She told me after the session — “If I knew this earlier, I would’ve saved myself so much frustration.”

Landlord Structure - Side Income/ Inherited Wealth
🏠 Major Cycle Forecast – Landlord Formation
10-Year Property Palace hosted combo stars + Hua Lu to Natal Wealth
Forecast: Multiple properties, wealth from real estate
No urge to chase side income — already felt stable
Verified: Parents passed down 2 properties ✅
Founder Timing Decision System™
Okay — so just now I showed you how Zi Wei can reveal the warnings: the mistakes, the misalignment, the things you should avoid.
But what most people don’t realize is — Zi Wei also reveals your hidden wealth path. Opportunities you may not even be aware of. Assets you didn’t know were already in your life.
This next example is what I call the Landlord Formation.
Let me show you one example. One of my female clients — she’s around 65 or 66 this year. Worked as a manager in the same company for decades. Now she’s ready to retire… wants to spend more time with family… But deep down, she wasn’t sure how. She didn’t want to just sit at home, So she joined in my 1on1 strategy session
When I looked at her chart — boom. There it was.
Her 10-Year Property Palace hosted combo stars and Hua Lu, directly connecting to her Natal Wealth Palace. This is what we call the Landlord Formation. Strong property luck. Inherited wealth indicators. Real estate fortune that didn’t require active effort.
And guess what? She didn’t even mention it at first. But after I pointed it out, she said: “Oh ya… My parents did say they’d pass down 2 houses to me.”
And she never even thought of it as her wealth path. She was still worrying about what side hustle to start — But her chart already told us: She’s already sitting on her path.
This is why I always say: Zi Wei doesn’t just tell you to work harder. It tells you where to direct your energy so you don’t waste years chasing the wrong game.
How many of you think this is amazing? To suddenly realize — you’ve been walking around with hidden inherited wealth all this time… just waiting to be claimed?
That’s why we built the Design Your Destiny program — so your chart isn’t just something you look at for fun… but something you actually use to unlock real-life direction.



If you could see the pattern before it crashes…
would you want to?
Founder Timing Decision System™
Ask them type yes in the chat…So… I know some of you are thinking: “Walao eh, this one so serious… I really got this kind of chart meh?”
But here’s the thing I want you to understand —
Zi Wei is not here to scare you. It’s here to give you clarity. To show you the signs before it’s too late.
Because what if you knew earlier? What if you saw the pattern, and adjusted course — before things collapsed?
Because most people i’ve consulted only see the truth after they crash. But you — you’re here now. Which means you’re ready to see the real picture.
Where are the chances?
Where are the hidden potential, hidden opportunities? Where are the traps?
That’s why I’ve prepared something for you: Different palace - different lenses into your life. Each one shows you a different part of your destiny.
And we’re starting with the most important one: Your Life Palace.
If you don’t even know who you really are… How are you supposed to know where you’re going?

Let me tell you this — When we use this kind of high-precision decision-making system, we don’t waste time asking shallow questions like: “Will I get rich?” “Will I win Toto?” “Will I be a billionaire someday?”
That’s not how you change your life.
The real transformation starts when you ask better questions. Deeper questions. Questions that actually guide your next move in the real world.
And in just a moment, I’m going to show you examples — the kind of questions that help you: 👉 Build a better career 👉 Make the right money move 👉 Choose the right relationship path 👉 Or even reset your health, energy, or environment
Because once you know what to ask, you start seeking the answer. You stop drifting. You start using a proven system to align your timing, energy, and decisions.
And that’s when your life starts to change.

“Question 2. Do you have a system to know if this year is push, pause, or protect?
If you just guess… that’s a 1. If you know exactly when to move, that’s a 5. Score yourself.”
“Question 3. Are you consistently putting 80% of your energy into the few things that actually matter?
If you’re scattered everywhere, give yourself a 1. If you’re always focused, give yourself a 5. Write it down.”
Question 4. In the last 12 months, did your effort multiply into visible progress — or just drain energy?
If you saw no clear results, that’s a 1. If you had strong, measurable growth, that’s a 5. Be honest with yourself.”
Question 5. When you think about the next 3 years, do you feel secure you’re on the right path… or do you secretly worry you’re drifting?
If you’re totally uncertain, give yourself a 1. If you feel absolutely secure, give yourself a 5. Score it now.”
Alright, now add them up. Your total score should be somewhere between 0 and 25.
Type your number in the chat — don’t be shy. Let’s see the spread.”
[Pause, react while reading aloud] “I see a 9… a 15… an 18… 23… someone even hit 25. Good!
Now… look at your number.
👉 If you’re on the low end, let’s not sugarcoat it — you’re drifting. You already know it. Another 12 months like this, and you’ll still be stuck at the same level.
👉 If you’re in the middle, it feels like you’re hustling… but you’re leaking power everywhere. You’re busy, but you’re not moving the needle.
👉 And if you’re on the high end, don’t get too comfortable. Ask yourself honestly: did you score high because you’re really aligned with your DNA, your Season, and your Activation? Or is it just brute force, luck, or willpower keeping you afloat?
Because if it’s not grounded in the chart… it’s fragile. One wrong decision, one bad season, and it all drops.
So whatever number you wrote, don’t take it lightly. This is your mirror. It shows you exactly where you’re strong, where you’re leaking, and where you’re vulnerable.”


Clarity x Timing x Activation = Results in real life
Founder Timing Decision System™
Let’s pull everything together.
Everything we’ve done these 3 days leads to this one simple equation: Clarity × Timing × Activation = Results in Real Life.
You can have clarity — know exactly who you are. You can catch the right timing. You can take massive action. But if the chart itself isn’t plotted correctly, if your starting point is even slightly off… you’ll spend years running hard in the wrong direction.
It’s like using Google Maps with the wrong pin. The map looks perfect. The route looks clear. But no matter how fast you drive, you’ll never arrive at the place you want.
And that’s why some people keep trying — new strategies, new mentors, new plans — but they still feel stuck. Because they’re moving, but not aligned.
Once your chart is fixed accurately, everything changes. Suddenly, timing matches effort. Your results multiply faster with half the struggle. It’s not luck — it’s precision.
That’s exactly why so many people — business owners, high-level professionals, even investors — come to me for private consultations. Not because they’re lost, but because they don’t want to waste another 10 years building on the wrong starting point. They want certainty.
And here’s what most people never realise: fixing your chart isn’t something you do every year. You do it once — but it can alter the direction of your next decade.
Moments like this don’t come often. This is one of those green-light windows life gives you. You see it. You feel it. And just like the traffic light — it doesn’t stay green forever.
Think about it… there are always people who make a move just before the boom —There are ppl who buy the property before the price explodes,They expand the business, that one wave everyone wishes they’d caught earlier. There are ppl who that promotion or switch careers just before everything takes off. Everyone else calls them “lucky,” but it’s not luck. They simply moved when others hesitated.
And that’s the truth — most people see the signal and still freeze. They tell themselves, ‘I’ll do it when I have more time,’ ‘I’ll do it after things settle down,’ ‘I’ll do it next round.’
And when they finally look up… the light’s red. The chance is gone. The season’s over. And they spend the next decade trying to rebuild the momentum they once had.
So if you can feel that pull — that quiet voice telling you this is it — don’t ignore it. Because clarity, timing, and activation rarely line up this perfectly.
This is that once-in-a-lifetime window. And what you do with it right now decides the kind of results you’ll live with for the next 10 years.


Founder Timing Decision System™
Can I be honest with you? I didn’t build this system because life was easy. I built it because I was stuck.
Back then, I was in corporate — doing everything people told me was the right thing. Work hard. Stay up late. Be reliable. You know that phrase, ‘Just keep your head down and good things will come?’ That was my life.
On the outside, it looked perfect. My boss praised me.My parents were proud of me too. My friends said, ‘Wah, you’re so hardworking.’ If I had to rate myself, maybe 18 out of 20. Looked solid. But inside… I was extremely tired.
I still remember walking out of the office car park one night — it was past midnight close to 1am. Everyone else had gone home. I saw the security guard locking up, and I remember thinking —he finishes his shift, I finish mine, but at least he goes home without guilt.
I was working myself sick chasing a life that didn’t even feel like mine.
 And I caught myself thinking, ‘If I’m doing everything right, why does it still feel like I’m going nowhere?’
You ever felt that before? 👉 You’re working hard, giving your best, but it feels like something just isn’t clicking. You’re moving, but not moving forward.
That was me.
I kept thinking the answer was just to work harder. Sleep less. Do more. Push through. Because that’s what everyone else was doing.
But one day, I looked at my chart — really looked at it — and I realised something.
It wasn’t asking me to do more. It was asking me to do different.
My energy wasn’t built for rushing. I’m someone who wins by building things that last. At that time, my chart showed it wasn’t my season to sprint — it was my season to reset, to strengthen my base, to rebuild properly.
So instead of just saying ‘yes’ to everything, I paused. I started reorganising my life — how I worked, who I surrounded myself with, where my energy was going.
And everything shifted. My stress dropped. My focus came back. And slowly, results started showing — more opportunities, better people, more stability.
That’s when it hit me — it’s not that I wasn’t capable. It’s that I was doing the right thing… at the wrong time.
Once I fixed that, life finally started compounding instead of draining.
👉 And that’s why I believe in this system so deeply. Because it didn’t just work for students — it worked on me first.
So if you’re here tonight — you’re hardworking, you’ve tried your best, but you secretly feel like something’s off… I get it. I’ve been there.
And I don’t want you to waste the next few years the way like i did.
That’s why I built Design Your Destiny System — so you can stop guessing, stop forcing, and finally move in the right direction, at the right time, with the right energy supporting you.”

So, i wanna be able to show you guys one last thing before we take a break, now that you have seen me talk about my priority & focus. You know one of the reason why do i what it is that i do, is because truly, this is what allowed me, to take care of my parents , retire them, give them the life that they deserve , thats to me what cooler than having alot of money is to have the ability to take care of my parents 
To me thats the real flex, thats something i really really proud of

That clarity? You don’t feel it until you’re in it. And when it lands… That’s when people tell me: ‘This wasn’t just worth it. It was necessary.’


You are just one decision away from a completely different destiny

I can show you the map. I can guide you through the timing, the strategies, the seasons. But the door only opens when you say yes.

Founder Timing Decision System™

IT’S $2.70 A DAY…
Founder Timing Decision System™
So… $997 a year, its kinda like $2 bucks a day. You cant even buy a starbucks a day.
The point im trying to make is, you will spend this money anyway, why not invest back in your own wealth path and timing advantage & get it back many times over

Founder Timing Decision System™
Let’s be real — people always end up spending more fixing problems they could’ve avoided. Like when you sign an agreement, maybe its for your business, for your property or stuff like that — you hire a lawyer, right? For founders, you will understand this better than anyone else. Not because you want to go to court, but because one small mistake in the contract can cost you 10,000 or even more to fix later.
Same thing in life. One wrong timing, one wrong move — it can set you back years. What I’m teaching you here is like your life’s lawyer — it helps you see what’s written in your chart before you make those big moves.


HOW ARE YOU SPENDING THIS AMOUNT RIGHT NOW?
Founder Timing Decision System™
So, the question i have for you is: where are you spending this amount right now?
What are you prioritizing right now?
It’s almost the end of 2025, 2026 is coming, are you going to start new year with the same old you?
Or you’re gonna start 2026 with a new you? Someone that your friends will impressed by, someone your family gonna be proud of, someone your children is gonna be admire of & look up to. So which one you wanna be?

Founder Timing Decision System™

NOW YOU HAVE 2 OPTIONS
1st Option
Do nothing, and when you wake up tomorrow, you’ll be doing the same exact thing you’re doing now.

If you’re ok with that, it’s fine.
2nd Option
Make this small investment.
Make a change, make a comeback. Gain back all the time & money you have lost.

Cause you know you’re meant for more.

Founder Timing Decision System™
Before i show you the 2 options:Take a moment to really consider this — what will it cost you to stay exactly where you are for another 12 months? The program starts at just $797, 2 bucks a day. but it’s more than an investment in learning. It’s an investment in your transformation, in your future. The real question is, what’s the price of staying stagnant for a whole year when nothing changes? Have you ever ask yourself this? What opportunities and growth would you miss? Think about that, and the doors to join us close at 12am today.

So now you have 2 options.

BEST CASE
VS
WORST CASE SCENARIO?
Founder Timing Decision System™
So, whats the best cas vs worst case scenario?
✅ Best Case:
Just like some of these examples & case studies you watched, it became the most fulfilling thing they did in their entire life. You change not just your own life — but your partner’s, your family’s, your clients’. And you now have a skillset, a system that you can use for life.
❌ Worst Case:
You go through the session, you apply what we teach… and nothing changes. No clarity. No momentum. No results. After a year, you look back and say: "That was one of the most confusing, painful experiences I’ve gone through. I tried my best, but I got nothing out of it.” And in that case — we give you your money back. No questions asked.



Get to decide what path you walk, when to take the leap, and who you become in the process.

No longer trapped by money, timing, or the wrong direction.

Reclaim the ownership of your life and be the one dictating the shots once again.
Founder Timing Decision System™
✅ Reclaim the ownership of your life and be the one dictating the shots once again.
(Your destiny is no longer in someone else’s hands. You call the shots, you set the pace, you choose the life you want.)

[slight pause, then firm tone]
“And that’s why I keep saying… you’re just one decision away from a completely different destiny.
The question is — will today be the day you take it?”

Let’s take a quick 5 minutes while you sign up and claim the bonuses…

And we’ll do a Q&A
Founder Timing Decision System™

After video, 

Ok so our team has compiled some FAQs, im gonna address all of them, if you stil have any question to add on, just feel free to type in the chat, the Q&A section.

Q&A

It’s too expensive
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2      |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

Fair question. “But too expensive… in comparison to what? Compared to wasting the next 3 years in the wrong job, wrong biz model, wrong decision? If this system helps you avoid just one wrong move — or helps you gain 3 right ones — how is that too much?The better question to ask is - what’s the real cost of continue staying stuck?What The real cost actually is - continue staying confused. Continue to be stagnant in the same environment, stagnant in the same situation, what would that cost it?” the energy drain, the mental breakdown, the sleepless nights, 
And on top of that — the financial bleed. Every wrong move is not just stress, it’s dollars out of your pocket. Three years in the wrong business model? That’s hundreds of thousands gone. Three years in the wrong job? That’s promotions missed, income capped, savings never built.
The truth is, staying stuck is the most expensive decision of all. Because while you hesitate, the bills don’t stop, inflation doesn’t stop, life doesn’t stop. Money is still leaving — it’s just not flowing back in at the level it could.
So really, the question isn’t whether this is expensive… The question is, how much longer can you afford to keep paying the price of confusion?”



I don’t have the time
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2      |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

"To be honest, You never really lack time. You just don’t prioritize it.
How much time do you spend scrolling on social media daily?
What if you invested that into something that actually moves your life forward?"
You can scroll Facebook for 2 hours — but not invest 2 hours to gain back 2 years of your life?
If you can’t make time for the thing that gives you clarity —
you’ll keep wasting time chasing the wrong thing.”

Can I sign up tomorrow?
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2      |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

Here’s the thing — I’m not going to tell you some fake story like, ‘Oh, we’ll never do this again,’ or ‘this will disappear forever.’ That’s not true.
We do open intakes for CAE a few times a year. So yes — technically, you can join next time.
But here’s the reality… Every intake, the price goes back to its normal rate — and all the special bonuses you see today are only for those who join during this live session.
The reason we do that is simple — we reward action-takers, not procrastinators. Because if you’ve been here for three days, you already know this isn’t about luck — it’s about timing.
And timing doesn’t wait. Right now, you’re in that window where your energy, your clarity, your momentum are all aligned. If you delay and say, ‘I’ll do it next round,’ life gets busy, your timing shifts, and most people never come back to it.
So to be transparent, can you still sign up for this tomorrow or the week after or a month after or a year after? Yes, but it is going to go back to our normal price without the bonuses. So if you wanna be able to claim this offer together with the bonuses we talked about today, you wanna do it right now over the next seven minutes before we proceed to the next part.
If you already know this is your green light — lock in your spot now while this window is still open.


Can I go do it myself?
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2      |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

Absolutely. There’s nothing stopping you. The truth is, everybody in the world can go do it themselves.
Everything is on a YouTube video, pretty much. This applies for anything — lose weight, real estate, investment, business — you can do anything yourself.
But the question we’ve got to ask is: if everybody can do anything themselves, then why don’t they just go do it? Because chances are, there’s too much information out there.
Number two, they don’t know what is the right thing to do because everything seems to be important.
And that’s why most people quit. Most people never see any results because they try to do it themselves, they make mistakes, and after making mistakes one, two, three times, they realize it’s too painful, and then they quit and say ‘This thing doesn’t work.’
Ultimately, if you want to avoid these mistakes, if you want to avoid trial and error, if you want to accelerate and get much faster results, then this will be for you.
But ultimately, whether you do it together with me or do it yourself, my goal is still for you to go do it.
But if you’re someone who wants to save time, move quicker, and learn through my mistakes and proven process — then come train with me.

I’m not ready yet
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2      |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

"The truth is — you’ll never feel ready.
Readiness is a myth.
You don’t wait for the feeling to act.
You act — and then the feeling shows up.
You’re not stuck because you’re not ready — you’re stuck because you keep waiting to be ready.”
Think about that for a second, It’s like you wanna learn how to swim, but if you never step into the water, will you ever get to learn how to swim? 

I’m scared I’ll still feel lost even after this
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2     |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

“You’re not scared of being lost.
You’re scared this is just another program that promises clarity — but ends up being vague.
That’s exactly why we built the software.
You’re not just getting a one-time explanation.
You’re getting a lifetime tool — to guide you through career moves, biz decisions, investment timing, even when to expand, to push or pause.
This app becomes your on-demand clarity compass.
So whenever life throws a fork in the road — you won’t guess. You’ll know the answers.”

It doesn’t feel right
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2      |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

“It’s not supposed to feel right. It’s supposed to feel new. The only thing that feels ‘right’… is the routine that’s been draining you — the job that numbs you, the decisions that confuse you. Eating a double cheeseburger or ramly burger at night feels right. And you know Going to the gym never feels right. But only one transforms you.
Same here — staying in your comfort zone feels safe. Facing your chart, decoding your destiny, committing to change — that feels weird. But that’s the one thing that’ll actually shift your life.”


How is this different from any other programs out there?
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2      |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

Great question —I’m not sure who asked this earlier, but ultimately, how is this different? Because let’s be honest… there are tons of programs, workshops, and courses out there promising transformation.
So what actually makes this different?
Well, I would say what makes it different is, Number one — I’m not a theorist. I’m a practitioner. A lot of people teach mindset, manifestation, or astrology, but most of them are repeating what they learned from someone else’s course or textbook. they’re doing it and they’re teaching it, they’re making money selling course based on theory.I don’t teach you theory — this is something that I actually do every single day with real people.
Every strategy, every framework, every insight I share in CAE comes directly from 1-on-1 consultations, from real clients who applied it, tested it, and got results in their actual lives — career changes, business growth, relationships, personal clarity.
And I don’t just talk about charts and stars — I show you how to turn that into real-world decisions. When to move. When to hold. When to reset. That’s why so many professionals and business owners keep coming back — because it’s not just spiritual knowledge, it’s a decision system you can actually use to time your next 10 years.
So when people ask, ‘What makes CAE different?’ The answer is simple — it’s not about giving you more information. It’s about giving you alignment. Because once your timing, direction, and action line up — your results stop depending on luck, and start following design.


What if it doesn’t work?
GET STARTED program: www.caegoh.com/go2     |       got question whatsapp: 6011-6834 9851

Okay, so what if it doesn’t work? Well, the first question I’ll ask you to think about is, what if it does work?
You already know that what you’re doing so far up to this point doesn’t work. But what if it did?
What if it did work? Like the way it did for many of our clients from different industry, different position,
But okay, let’s entertain this for a second. But what if it really doesn’t work? What if you truly tried the systems, the processes, the strategies, you attended, you put in the work, you utilized everything I taught, and for some reason you put it to work, and somehow for some weird reason it just didn’t work.
If that’s the case, you text our team, you show us what it is that you’ve done, you’ve implemented the steps, the strategies, we give you a full refund and you get to keep those training and resources. ‘Well, thank you for trying this out,’ right?
So best-case scenario is it changes your life. Worst-case scenario, if it doesn’t work, you get 100 percent of your return on your investment. But again, what if it does work?
