Everyone Has a Unique Wealth Code.
Yours is Written in Your Stars.
🧭 Based on the star(s) inside your chart,
 you’ll fall into one of 4 Wealth Code Categories, or even more —
based on real money-making traits, not vague personality types.
So let me introduce you to the 4 Wealth Codes - draw this 4 boxes with me:
“There are 4 major Wealth Code types that show up again and again —
 and most people fall into one of them.”
“Let’s go through each one now.
 As I speak, pay attention to which one feels most like you.”
“If your star matches what I mention — great.
 If not, don’t worry. This is just the first layer.
 You’ll get full confirmation when we break down your entire chart later.”


🤝 Collaborator
Loyal. Emotionally intelligent. Relationship-based.
You’re not here to do it all alone.
You shine in partnerships, service-based roles, people-oriented paths.
You win through deep trust and team power.

I’ll be revealing each star under every wealth code — one by one.
The next one might be your star.
 Or it could be your spouse’s, your friend’s, your client’s…
 And with time cycles constantly shifting, any star could become relevant to you.
So be patient with your turn.
 This process is intentional — we’re building real understanding, not shortcuts.

“Alright, let’s start with the first wealth code of the day — and this one is for the thinkers, the planners, the system builders.
These are the people who don’t randomly chase money. They want to know:
 👉 What’s the structure?
 👉 What’s the logic?
 👉 What’s the long-term game?
They build their wealth through strategy and control.
 They’re not here for quick hacks.
 They’re here to build something that lasts — a system, a plan, or a team that works even when they’re not there.
If you’re someone who always needs a plan before you move —
 or you get frustrated when things are messy, uncertain, or inefficient —
 this might be your wealth code.”


“So who falls under the Strategy Planner wealth code?
👉 Stars like ziwei, tian liang, lianzhen, tianji 
These stars are naturally strong in logic, structure, and seeing the big picture.
 They can take chaos and turn it into clarity.
 They’re the backbone of systems, frameworks, and long-term planning.”


“Now let’s talk about how a Strategy Planner can actually create side income.
Your strength is not hype. Your strength is not chasing the next shiny thing.
 👉 Your real strength is structure — you see the big picture, you build frameworks, and you create systems that others can follow.
So what does that look like in today’s world?
 Here are some practical business ideas for Strategy Planners:
Build a coaching or service business → people pay you to guide them step by step, with a clear A–Z plan.


Sell templates or toolkits → SOPs, org charts, checklists. Set it up once, sell repeatedly, and let auto-delivery handle it.


Offer HR & operations services → help businesses plan talent, restructure teams, and organize workflows. Companies will pay for clarity.


Set up productivity systems (Notion, ClickUp, Airtable) → one-time build, clients pay you per system. This is a big trend now.


Package your expertise into a mini-course → record it once, and sell it many times online.


👉 Do you see the pattern here?
 You don’t need to chase attention like an influencer.
 You monetize by turning your systems, frameworks, and structure into something others can use.
“And here’s the best part — it doesn’t matter what industry you come from, or what background you have. As long as you can organize your knowledge, structure your expertise, and package it in the right way, you can turn it into income.
👉 This wealth code works across every industry — because every field needs clarity, structure, and strategy.”







“Alright, let’s wrap up the Strategy Planner wealth code with a quick recap.
✅ Strength: You see systems. You think in frameworks. You have the rare ability to take chaos and turn it into clarity. You can map out plans, processes, and strategies that work not just today — but for the long term.
⚠️ Trap: But your biggest trap is that you often stay behind the scenes too long. You doubt your own visibility. You hide when you should step forward. You keep building quietly in the background, when sometimes the breakthrough comes only when you dare to lead.
❌ Misaligned Path: The path that doesn’t suit you is fast-moving hype. Influencer-style hustle. Crowd-chasing trends that don’t last. That’s not your lane. It doesn’t play to your strength, and it will only drain you.
👉 Remember this: your wealth doesn’t come from being the loudest voice in the room. It comes from clarity and structure.
 When you take your planning brain and turn it into systems, frameworks, or organized teams — that’s when you build income that’s real, reliable, and lasting.”


“Now, let’s move into the second wealth code — the Investment Brain.
These stars don’t like guessing. They want to see the numbers before they make a move.
They grow their wealth through assets, savings, careful decisions, and consistent action.
 They may move slower than others — but every step they take is measured, steady, and intentional.
If you’re someone who prefers security over hype, and you like to know the numbers before you commit — this might be your wealth code.”


“So who belongs to the Investment Brain wealth code?
👉 Stars like Wu Qu, Tian Fu, Tai Yin, Wen Qu.
Wu Qu is resourceful and finance-driven — loves managing money.


Tian Fu is conservative — prefers safe and steady growth.


Tai Yin loves to save and values security.


Together, these stars are naturally drawn toward stability, numbers, and building assets over time.”



“Now let’s talk about how an Investment Brain can create side income.
For you, it’s not about chasing fast hype. Your best path is building assets and steady streams that can compound over time. Let me give you five practical examples:
1. Buy property and rent it out.
 This is the classic wealth builder. You don’t need ten houses — even one small unit, rented out, becomes a side income stream. Example: buy a studio unit, rent it for RM1,500/month, and that’s extra cashflow on top of your main career. Over years, you still own the asset and the value appreciates.
2. Buy good company stocks and hold for dividends.
 Instead of chasing daily trades, you focus on long-term. Think of strong companies like banks, utilities, or blue chips. You buy, you hold, and every quarter they pay you dividends. Example: owning 1,000 shares of a dividend stock might give you RM500–RM1,000 every few months without lifting a finger.
3. Sell digital products or ebooks.
 This is the “modern asset.” You create it once — like a guide, a checklist, or an ebook on something you know — and set it up on auto-delivery. For example, an Investment Brain who’s good with Excel templates could sell a “Budget & Investment Tracker” online. You build once, and each sale brings in passive side income.
4. Invest in crypto staking or REITs.
 This is for those who want exposure beyond traditional assets. Staking lets you lock coins and earn interest, like putting money in a high-interest savings account. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) let you own a slice of properties without buying the whole building. Example: you invest RM10k in a REIT and receive quarterly rental income distribution. Steady, predictable, and aligned with your cautious nature.
5. Set up a Shopee or Lazada store — with an agent running it.
 Here’s a modern twist. You don’t need to sit and pack products every day. Hire an agent or use dropshipping to handle operations. You just fund the setup, choose the products, and monitor the numbers. Example: selling kitchen tools, beauty products, or home gadgets. You focus on the asset (the store), not the manual labor.
👉 Do you see the pattern here?
 You don’t need side income that’s flashy or fast. You need side income that feels like assets — things that you build once and they continue giving back.
And when you do this, it won’t just be “extra money.” It becomes the foundation of your retirement freedom.”
“And remember — it doesn’t matter what industry you’re in, or what career path you’ve taken. Every field has assets you can own, whether it’s property, company shares, or even digital products.
👉 The key is the same: focus on building what lasts, so your money keeps working for you no matter where you come from.”



“Let’s recap the Investment Brain wealth code.
✅ Strength: You’re careful, consistent, and steady. You build wealth through assets, savings, and smart moves that last long term.
⚠️ Trap: But sometimes you become too cautious. You overthink, you wait too long, and as a result, you miss opportunities that were already good.
❌ Misaligned Path: Anything too risky, too hype-driven, or based on fast gambles. That’s not your strength, and it usually ends in regret.
👉 Remember: your wealth comes from patience and consistency. When you trust your numbers and play the long game, you’ll always come out ahead.”

“Now, let’s move into the third wealth code — the Branding Magnet.
These are the people with natural charisma. Wherever they go, they attract attention.
They build their wealth through influence and visibility.
 They know how to turn presence into opportunities.
If you’re someone who people naturally notice, who loves to express yourself, or who enjoys being in the spotlight — this might be your wealth code.”


“So who belongs to the Branding Magnet wealth code?
👉 Stars like Tan Lang, Ju Men, Tai Yang, Qi Sha, and Po Jun.


Tan Lang is charm and attraction — the classic social magnet.


Ju Men is the mouthpiece — persuasive, expressive, strong in communication.


Tai Yang is the sun — naturally shining, giving visibility and warmth.


Qi Sha is bold and daring — the kind of person who stands out because they take risks others won’t.


Po Jun is disruptive — they shake things up, challenge the norm, and leave a lasting impression.


Put together, these stars show someone who is born to be visible — to lead, to influence, and to turn their presence into opportunities.”


“Now let’s talk about how Branding Magnets can build side income.
For you, the formula is clear: visibility creates opportunity. The more people see you, hear you, and remember you — the more ways you can monetize. Let me give you five practical paths:
1. Shoot short-form videos.
 Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts are perfect for you. You don’t need millions of followers — even a few thousand loyal viewers can bring clients or brands knocking. Example: A Branding Magnet who talks about skincare could land collaborations with beauty brands just by posting consistent, authentic videos.
2. Be a brand ambassador.
 Instead of just posting for fun, turn your influence into income. Companies are constantly looking for faces that people trust. Example: promoting a fitness brand, healthy food, or even software tools you use. They pay you in commission, free products, or even monthly retainers to represent them.
3. Host live events or webinars.
 You don’t have to be Joey Yap-level to start. Even small group workshops or online webinars work. You charge tickets, or upsell into your program, product, or service. Example: running a “Weekend Personal Branding Bootcamp” — 20 people paying RM100 each is already RM2,000 side income in one session.
4. Write a book.
 It doesn’t have to be a 300-page bestseller. Even a short e-book positions you as an authority. Example: “10 Secrets to Building Confidence on Camera.” Once published, you can sell it online, or use it as a tool to land speaking gigs, coaching clients, or media features.
5. Create digital products.
 Turn your knowledge or talent into something that sells while you sleep. Example: Canva template packs, presentation slide designs, or even a “Personal Branding Checklist.” You build once, and every download becomes extra side income.
👉 Do you see the theme here?
 Your strength is in being seen and remembered. When you put yourself out there — whether it’s through video, writing, events, or partnerships — opportunities naturally convert into income.”



🎤 Script:
 “Let’s wrap up the Branding Magnet wealth code.
✅ Strength: You have natural charisma. People notice you, they listen to you, and you can use your influence to open doors.
⚠️ Trap: But your trap is going too heavy on the surface. All show, no structure. Or you chase too much visibility without turning it into income — leading to burnout.
❌ Misaligned Path: Staying hidden, avoiding the spotlight, or trying to build wealth quietly in the background. That’s not you.
👉 And here’s the reminder: no matter your background or industry, your personal brand can be turned into income. Whether you’re in business, education, creative, or even corporate — when you let yourself be seen, you can use your influence as leverage to create wealth.”

“Now let’s move into the fourth wealth code — the Collaborator.
These are the people who shine when working with others. They don’t always want to do everything alone — their strength is finding the right people and creating win-win opportunities.
They build wealth by partnering, connecting, and leveraging networks.
 If you’re someone who prefers teamwork over solo hustle, who feels more energized when you’re collaborating — this might be your wealth code.”



“So who belongs to the Collaborator wealth code?
👉 Stars like Zuo Fu, You Bi, Wen Chang, Wen Qu
Zuo Fu is the supportive helper — always there to guide or back you up.


You Bi is the alliance-builder — skilled at forming partnerships.


Wen Chang and Wen Qu are the brains of the team — great at communication, coordination, and refinement.


Together, these stars show someone who succeeds not by standing alone, but by multiplying strength through connection.”




“Now let’s talk about side income for Collaborators.
For you, the wealth path is all about working with others. You don’t need to carry the whole load yourself — your gift is creating partnerships where everyone wins.
Here are five practical ideas:
1. Co-launch a business with a partner.
 Find someone with skills you don’t have. You handle what you’re good at, they handle the rest, and you split the profits. Example: you manage operations while your partner handles sales.
2. Run group programs or retreats.
 Co-host events, workshops, or retreats. Each of you brings different strengths, and together you attract more people. Example: a wellness coach teams up with a yoga teacher — both benefit, both share revenue.
3. Start a referral or affiliate business.
 You don’t need to create everything yourself. Connect people to products or services and take a commission per sale. Example: referring clients to software tools, training programs, or even property agents.
4. Be the middleman in deals.
 Sometimes money is made not from doing the work, but from connecting the right people. Example: you introduce a supplier to a retailer, and you take a cut from the deal.
5. Bundle your service with others.
 If you already have a service, partner with others to create packages. Example: a copywriter collaborates with a designer and marketer — they sell a complete package, and each earns more than selling alone.
👉 For Collaborators, income grows fastest when you stop thinking solo and start asking: Who can I work with to make this bigger?”


“Let’s recap the Collaborator wealth code.
✅ Strength: You thrive in partnerships. You know how to form alliances and multiply results through teamwork.
⚠️ Trap: But your biggest trap is becoming too dependent on others. If you don’t choose partners wisely, you can get stuck or even taken advantage of.
❌ Misaligned Path: Trying to do everything yourself, forcing a solo grind. That drains your energy and blocks your true potential.
👉 And here’s the best part: no matter what industry you’re in, collaboration is everywhere. Whether it’s business, education, healthcare, or creative industries — there’s always a way to team up, bundle skills, and create something bigger than yourself. That’s how you, as a Collaborator, unlock your wealth.”

“Think of it this way:
Strategy Planner is The Architect — the one who builds the blueprint, the structure, the system.


Investment Brain is The Builder — patient, steady, stacking bricks of wealth until they create real freedom.


Branding Magnet is The Influencer — turning visibility and charisma into opportunities and income.


Collaborator is The Connector — bringing people together, creating partnerships where everyone wins.


👉 Each wealth code has a different path — and once you know yours, you stop fighting against yourself and start walking the road built for you.”






“Before we close today, I want you to remember this one thing:
👉 Your side income is not about luck. It’s about alignment.
Too many people waste years chasing hype, following random advice, or copying what works for others. And then they wonder why it doesn’t last.
But today, you’ve seen — every person has a different wealth code.
 Some of you are Strategy Planners — you create income by turning structure into clarity.
 Some of you are Investment Brains — you build wealth patiently, through assets that last.
 Some of you are Branding Magnets — you attract opportunities through your presence and influence.
 And some of you are Collaborators — you multiply success by working with others.
When you align your side income with your natural wealth code, everything feels different. You stop forcing yourself into paths that drain you. You stop comparing yourself with people who are built differently.
Instead, you start walking your own road — the one where your strengths become your advantage, and your side income grows in a way that feels natural, sustainable, and lasting.
So as you leave this training, I don’t want you to just chase the next big trend.
 I want you to ask yourself: Am I aligned?
👉 Because side income isn’t luck. It’s alignment.
 And alignment is what creates destiny.”
