WEALTH RULES
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS
Especially in the second half of 2025…
Hi everyone! 👋 Welcome to tonight’s coaching call —

Zi Wei = 
Wealth Formula
Make decisions with clarity, no guesswork. 
“Do you remember back in school, when we learned Mathematics? Every single thing had a formula.
Addition and subtraction? Formula.
Geometry? Pythagoras theorem.
Physics? F = ma.
And because there was a formula, you could always reach the right answer. There was certainty.
But when it comes to our life decisions — money, career, business — how do most people decide? They guess. They follow feelings. They rely on friends’ opinions. That’s why many times… they end up making the wrong move, at the wrong time.
Now here’s the good news: Zi Wei Dou Shu is like your Wealth Formula.
Inside your chart, every palace, every star, every activation is an indicator. They are like formulas waiting for you to use.
And when you know how to read them… 👉 You’ll know exactly when it’s the right time to move. 👉 You’ll know when you should hold back. 👉 You’ll even know when to walk away completely.
That’s what today’s session is all about — Wealth Rules.
Just like how formulas gave you certainty in school, these Wealth Rules will give you certainty in life and in wealth. Because once you master them, you no longer need to guess. You’ll have a system — a formula — to make the right move at the right time.”

“Take a step back and think about what you just experienced.
We didn’t stay in theory today — you actually went into the chart. You looked at the palaces, tracked the activations, tested the flying stars… and you saw it for yourself: 👉 Who has the energy to create, 👉 Who should hold back, 👉 Who will waste effort if they push at the wrong time.
That’s the true value of Zi Wei. It turns something invisible into clarity. Most people spend their whole lives guessing — but today, you’ve seen with your own eyes how the chart gives you a formula.
And let me ask you — when you compared charts just now, could you immediately feel the difference between who’s aligned and who’s not? If yes, type a YES in the chat right now.
(👀 Pause, let them respond, acknowledge a few by name: “I see your YES, amazing…”)
If you already felt that difference in just a few exercises… imagine how powerful it gets when you layer in the full Wealth Rules to guide your career, your investments, even your next 10 years.
That’s why today is so valuable. Because you’re no longer guessing. You’re learning to read your chart as a living map — one that shows you not only who you are, but what to do next, at the right time.
And that brings us to what I call your Biggest Takeaway today…”
