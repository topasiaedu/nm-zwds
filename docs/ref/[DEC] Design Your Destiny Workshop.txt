Unlock Your Wealth Blueprint, Stop Guessing & Start Moving
— CAE, International Destiny Strategist

“You know, I always compare life to a game of cards.
When you sit down at the table, the cards that you’re holding — those are your fixed factors (定数). You didn’t get to choose them. That’s your Zi Wei chart, your natural wiring.
It shows you what you’re naturally good at, your strengths, your potential, and yes, even your weaknesses.
But what you do with those cards — whether you fold, whether you take a risk, whether you double down, or shift your move — that’s entirely up to you. That’s what we call the variable (变数).
Now, why do I start with this? Because here’s the funny thing: most people spend their entire life complaining about the cards they hold.
They look at their chart and say: ‘Aiya, why don’t I have the good stars?’ ‘Why does everyone else’s chart look so much better?’ ‘If only I had Warren Buffett’s chart, then sure win already, right?’
But the truth is this: even if you are dealt a so-called lousy hand, if you play it well, you can still win. And on the flip side, even if you get amazing cards, but you play them badly, you will still lose.
That’s why these 3 days are not about magically changing your card..  You cannot change the hand you were dealt. Instead, it’s about learning how to play them better.



2

TURN YOUR FIXED FACTOR TO VARIABLES
That’s what I call having the dealer mindset (庄家思维). You can’t decide which cards you’re given, but you can absolutely decide how you’re going to play them.
So for example —
If you see from your chart that you’re not suited for heavy investing, then don’t force it. Maybe just put in a small amount to test the waters.
If you see you’re not cut out for employment and this is your window to strike out, then that’s when you need to switch lanes and go all-in on entrepreneurship.
But if you look at your chart and the first thing you feel is fear… you panic, you escape, you think, ‘If I just ignore this, maybe it’ll go away’ — then you’re just following the script blindly.
If your true goal is to change your life, then you must adjust your strategy. There’s no other way.
And remember this: having Ji (忌) in your chart is not the end of the world. It doesn’t mean disaster. It only means you need to know the method to work around it. Fear doesn’t help. Strategy does.
So as we begin today, I want you to hold onto one simple truth: 👉 Your chart sets the boundaries. 👉 Your choices decide the outcome.
If you can understand both, you’ll stop complaining and start strategizing.
These 3 days, our work together is to take your fixed factors and learn how to turn them into variables you can control. To make you the player of your own life — the dealer at the table — not just some NPC blindly following a script.”

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
1
Read Your Chart With A Purpose
If you don’t set a goal, it’s like driving a car without a steering wheel — you’ll just get lost.
“So how exactly do we do this? There are 4 important principles.”

1. Look at your chart with a purpose (因事看盘)
“Before you even open your chart, ask yourself: what am I looking for? Is it career? Wealth? Direction? Relationships?
If you don’t set a goal, it’s like driving a car without a steering wheel — you’ll just get lost.
Always look at your chart with a specific intention. Otherwise, you’ll end up confused, or worse, you’ll let the chart control you instead of you using it as a tool.”

2
Adjust Your Strategy
Zi Wei exists to give you clarity. Adjust Your Path 
Intelligently.
2. Adjust your strategy
“If you see this is not your year to take risks, then don’t force it. If you’re not suited for investment, don’t dump your whole savings inside — start small instead.
If you see this is your time to break out and start a business, then don’t waste the season working a job that keeps you stuck. Switch lanes.
Remember we’re here to turn the fixed factors into variables you can control, don’t just follow the chart blindly .

3
Keep An Empty-Cup Mindset
Don’t pretend to be smart. Come in with an empty cup. 
Explore Your Potential & Possibilities.
3. Keep an empty-cup mindset (保持空杯心态)
“The third principle is this: Keep an empty-cup mindset.
Some of you here have already studied BaZi, or maybe Qi Men Dun Jia, or even numerology. And that’s great — each system is powerful in its own way.
Take BaZi for example. BaZi is primarily built on the Five Elements. Everything ties back to whether you are Yang Wood, Yin Metal, Yin Water, and then studying how the Five Elements interact with each other.
Qi Men Dun Jia, on the other hand, is very focused on time, space, and energy configurations. It’s often used for short-term, tactical decisions — like ‘what’s the best timing to act?’
But Zi Wei Dou Shu works differently. The way I teach Zi Wei focuses heavily on the Flying Stars method — the interaction between the Heavenly Stems and the Stars within your chart.
And here’s the exciting part: in Zi Wei, the energy doesn’t just sit there. It can fly out. Which means you’re not stuck. It gives you flexibility. You can adjust your long-term strategy, and also fine-tune your short-term actions — which makes it extremely adaptable for the modern era.
Zi Wei doesn’t ignore the Five Elements — it simply uses them differently. The stars and palaces are the main drivers, while the Five Elements act as an extra layer of meaning, especially useful in health-related interpretations.
That’s why I always remind my students: don’t try to look at Zi Wei through the same lens as BaZi. Zi Wei is a completely different system. Historically, it was created for emperors — not for fortune-telling — but for making major decisions, setting the direction of an entire kingdom.
If you cling to old methods, or worse, if you try to mix everything together without really understanding, you’ll only confuse yourself. That’s why I always say: don’t pretend to be smart.
Come in with an empty cup. Learn Zi Wei on its own terms first. And once you do, you’ll see just how powerful and precise it really is.”

Help & Empower Others
Good Heart = Good Luck. Guide and empower, do GOOD only. 
“And finally — once you learn this, use it responsibly.
If you look at someone’s chart and you see they are in a 平平清云 year, you don’t need to tell them, ‘Oh, you’re unlucky, you’ll lose money, you’re going to fail.’ That only creates fear.
Instead, you can say, ‘This is a year to stay steady. Focus on your skills. Strengthen your career foundation. Build what you can control.’
Because remember: 运是思维 — your luck follows your thinking. If you plant fear in someone’s mind, they’ll live fearfully. But if you guide them with clarity, they can make wiser choices and create better outcomes.
Zi Wei is not about predicting doom. It’s about empowering people — giving them direction, confidence, and the ability to make better decisions.
And this is exactly the same for you.
I’m not here over these 3 days to scare you, or to give you some vague predictions. I’m here to give you clarity, strategy, and tools you can actually use.

MY GOAL FOR THIS 3 DAYS
1
BE YOUR OWN STRATEGIST
Most people skip their own chart and run to read others
because it’s easier than taking responsibility for their life.
2
LEAVE WITH CLARITY
Dissolve confusion and gain profound clarity about your life path and current circumstances
3
PERSONALIZED STRATEGY PLAN
Develop strategic foresight to make confident decisions aligned with your destiny
4
10X EFFICIENCY
Skip years of costly trial and error by leveraging ancient wisdom customized to your unique chart
First, I want you to be your own strategist. Not dependent on others, not blindly following advice — but knowing how to read, plan, and adjust for yourself.
Second, I want you to leave with clarity. To see yourself clearly — your strengths, your weaknesses, and your current season — so you stop doubting and start moving with confidence.
Third, I want you to walk away with a personalized strategy plan. Not a one-size-fits-all answer, but a roadmap built on your chart, your timing, your goals.
And finally, I want you to experience what happens when you have clarity and strategy working together: you achieve 10X efficiency. You stop wasting years on detours. You stop pouring energy into things that don’t matter. Instead, you channel your time, money, and effort into the few moves that will create the biggest results.

ZI WEI DOU SHU
=
A system once used by emperors to read the 
World’s Timing
Most people think Zi Wei Dou Shu is just a chart. Like fortune-telling. Like the usual metaphysics tool that you’ve been exploring along the way  Just to check “luck” or maybe see if you will be rich or poor.
But that’s not where it started.
Zi Wei Dou Shu was not for fun.In fact, It was a premium reading system only used by emperors in the old days.
Why?
Because back then, one wrong decision from the emperor… could affect the whole empire — not just himself.
Should we go to war? Should we make peace with another country? Should we raise taxes? Should I pass the throne to my son now or later?
Every big decision… was guided by the Zi Wei chart.
That’s why we say:
"Zi Wei = A system once used by emperors to read the world’s timing."

But here’s the key:
The emperors didn’t just read the chart to check their luck. They didn’t say,
“Oh, I have Wu Qu star in my Wealth Palace, so this is the time to go conquer a new land!”
No. They didn’t make decisions based only on what star was in what palace.
Because the star might look good… but if it’s not activated that year, then it means the timing is not mature yet.
They knew — It’s not just about what you have. It’s about what’s moving.


WHY DO I SAY PURPLE STAR ASTROLOGY IS RARE?
1
Royal Origins
Zi Wei was created for the royal court. Attributed to Taoist master Chen Tuan, used for emperors' fate decisions. It was for leaders, strategists, and legacy decisions
2
Hidden Knowledge
Hidden From the Masses. Not Because It's Hard, But Because It's Powerful. It wasn't popularized like other systems, not because it's "too complex" but because it was too precious. A tool like this… was kept for those who needed to lead
3
Strategic Tool
A Strategic Tool,  Not Just a Personality Test. Focused on timing, power, wealth, and life cycles. Designed to help rulers decide wars, marriages, legacy
4
Exclusive Access
That's Why Few People Know It Exists. It was kept behind palace doors, You don't see it on daily horoscopes, because this isn't "guesswork". It's a life direction system, built for clarity and timing
5
Now Available
Now It's Finally Accessible for Those Who Want More Than Just Motivation. If you're ready to move with precision. Zi Wei gives you the same strategic advantage… emperors once had

You know, many people always ask me — “Is life fated?”
What do you think? How many of you believe that life is already written? Type “FATED” in the chat if you think so.
(👀 pause, watch chat flood)
The truth is — yes, many things are written. From the moment you were born, your chart already gave you a life script.
That’s your default blueprint — your DNA. If not, you wouldn’t have your own unique Zi Wei chart, right?
Some people are playing the “rich but suffer” script. Some are playing the “suffer first, succeed later” script. And some… just keep replaying the same story every single year.
But here’s what most people never realise — no matter what script you’re born with, you still get to decide how you play it.
Let me share something personal.
When I was around 12, someone told me —
“You won’t live past this age.”
That was what my chart said. If that was my script, what should I do? Just accept it? Wait for it to happen?
If I had believed that… I would’ve been just another actor in my own life — reading the lines someone else wrote for me.
But when I learned how to decode my own chart, when I started to understand my timing, my energy, my season — I realised something powerful: I don’t have to follow the script. I can direct it.
Let me put it in a way everyone can understand.
How many of you love watching movies, dramas, Netflix, or TVB shows? Type “ME” in the chat.
(pause, smile, wait for chat flood)

EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON
YIN YANG =
The law of balance
The law of karma
The law of truth
☯ What Is Yin Yang — Really?
People always say…“Everything happens for a reason.”
But have you ever stopped to ask:What does that actually mean?
It’s not just a motivational quote.It’s a universal law.
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, we call it: 因果定律 — the Law of Cause and Effect. Or simply put: Yin Yang.
Now I know what you’re thinking —“Isn’t that some spiritual or Chinese thing?”Not really.
Yin Yang isn’t religious. It’s not about belief. It’s just how the universe works.
Every up has a down. Every action has a reaction. Every seed you plant… eventually becomes a harvest.
🌱 Maybe years ago, you planted a seed — A belief you never questioned. A pattern you kept repeating. A decision you made out of fear, habit, or pressure.
🌳 And now, you’re just living the harvest of it.
That’s Yin Yang: The law of balance, The law of karma, The law of truth — whether you believe it or not.
That’s why Zi Wei Dou Shu is so powerful. It doesn’t just “predict” your future.
It helps you connect the dots backwards — to understand why things happened the way they did.
Every palace. Every star. Every transformation. They’re not random. They’re karmic receipts — showing you what chapter of life is trying to teach you something.

🧠 But I’m Not Here Just to Read Your Fate.
I’m here to help you rewrite your cause.
Because once you see the pattern... Once you understand the effect you’re stuck in... You can finally plant a new cause — with intention.
🌕 That’s the real meaning of Yin Yang. It’s not just balance. It’s motion. It’s choice. It’s the idea that even your darkest cycle… contains the spark of a turnaround.
But only if you’re willing to trace the root — and choose again.

WHAT IS CONTROLLING YOUR 
"YIN" & "YANG"?
18

EMOTION BALANCE
YANG
POSITIVITY
YIN
NEGATIVITY
☯ Yin Yang Isn’t Just Energy — It’s Emotion.
Let’s get real for a second.
Yin represents the “negative” side — sadness, tiredness, fear, doubt. Yang represents the “positive” — confidence, joy, drive, clarity.
But most people misunderstand this. They think being “spiritual” means they always have to be calm and positive. That’s not true.
Yin and Yang are not enemies. They’re a cycle.
Yes — you’ll have days when you’re off. Yes — you’ll feel frustrated, stuck, angry, hopeless.
But here’s the real question: Do you stay there?
Or do you shift?
And this is where the real game begins. It’s not about avoiding Yin or chasing Yang — both will come, whether you like it or not. The real question is… what do you do when the Yin hits?
Do you freeze? Do you fight? Or do you turn it into fuel? Because that one choice… decides whether you stay stuck where you are, or break into a whole new level.
Let me show you exactly what I mean

"From Confusion to Clarity : 
How You'll Grow During This Journey"
This STAGE you’re about to see… it’s the journey every single person takes — whether they know it or not.
And where you are on it right now?
It explains exactly why you feel the way you do… and why some people keep breaking limits while others stay stuck for years.

THE DESTINY LEARNING STAGE™
"From Confusion to Clarity: How You'll Grow During This Journey"
THE CAGED
😵‍💫 Victim Mindset 
1
1. THE CAGED
Have a victim mentality — feel helpless, pessimistic, and make decisions based on negative emotions. 
Believe “the world is unfair” and blame external forces (government, economy, bad chart, parents). 
Constantly seek validation for why life is hard. Secretly hope suffering will end on its own — ask questions like “When will I be rich?” or “When will this end?”. 
Spend more time explaining why things won’t work than finding solutions. Feel powerless and think success is only for the lucky or privileged. 
2. Survivors 
In constant survival mode — hardworking and decent, but keep falling behind. 
Hustle all the time: “I just need to make enough to get through this month.” Burned out but afraid to stop. Submit to power and authority, neutral outlook — “If it suits me, I believe it.” 
Know they need to learn more or dream bigger but say they have “no time.” Dreams take a backseat to daily responsibilities. 
Fear of losing what they have stops them from taking risks. Decisions are reactive to circumstances rather than strategic. 
3. Thrivers 
Mindset of abundance and growth. Always ask “Tell me what I can do next” rather than “When will this end?”. Proactive, future-focused, realistic yet optimistic. Look for opportunities, make calculated decisions, live in the moment for the future. Expect challenges but see them as opportunities to adapt and improve. Ask “How can I afford it?” or “How can I find a way?” instead of “I can’t afford it.” Focus on empowering themselves and others, continuously taking the next step forward.

UNDERSTANDING 
ZIWEI DECODING APPROACH
24

ZI WEI DOU SHU:
SAN HE OR FOUR ACTIVATION? (SI HUA)

A lot of people ask me: “There are so many styles of Zi Wei Dou Shu… so which one should I follow?”
Today, I’ll break it down very clearly for you: There are two major styles — San He and Four Transformations.
San He is the traditional one. It looks at 3 main palaces — Life, Wealth, and Career — and sees if your chart is “noble,” “rich,” or “blessed.”
It’s like saying: Are you born with a good engine? But here’s the problem: It won’t tell you when to press the accelerator.
Four Transformations, on the other hand — this is what we use in CAE — tells you exactly what is being activated this year.
For example:
Lu flies into your Wealth Palace = money flowing in
Ji flies into your Spouse Palace = relationship tension or distance
Quan flies into Career = you’ll feel the urge to take charge or rise up
So it’s not just about “who you are.” It’s about what is shifting in your life — right now.
That’s why Four Transformations is so powerful. It helps you make smart decisions, at the right time. It’s not just reading your fate — it’s navigating your next 10 years.
So if you’re looking for real answers, not just abstract fortune-telling — this is the system you want to master.

💡 Optional SLIDE 3 (Analogy Slide):
"San He is the Engine. Four Transformations is the GPS." 📌 Pointform:
San He = Shows what car you’re driving (powerful? luxurious? slow?)
Four Transformations = Shows where you are, and when to turn
Without GPS, you’ll miss the timing — even if you’re driving a Ferrari
CAE teaches both — but we drive with the GPS on

12 PALACES
= DIFFERENT AREA 
OF YOUR LIFE
- ziwei system has categorized your life into 12 palaces

OPPOSITE PALACE RELATIONSHIPS
SAMPLE CHART
Most people only focus on what’s inside their Zi Wei chart.
What stars they have.
What transformations are flying in.
What activations look strong.
But they forget something powerful:
In Zi Wei Dou Shu — everything has an opposite.
And sometimes… your biggest clue isn’t in the palace you’re staring at.
It’s the one directly across.
I call these “hidden mirrors.”
And once you learn how to read them —
You stop guessing. You start decoding.

LIFE x TRAVEL PALACE
Why “staying safe” is the most expensive decision?
SAMPLE CHART
You can’t find your destiny if you never leave your comfort zone.
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, your Life Palace is directly opposite your Travel Palace.
Your entire life path is influenced by what happens when you step out.
If you never go out, how will you find opportunities?
If you never meet new people, how will your next breakthrough arrive?
Now pause.
Write down the names of the 3 people closest to you right now.
Because whether you realize it or not — they are a reflection of you.
CONCLUSION: 
Your destiny isn’t waiting at home
Who you meet changes your entire life path

SAMPLE CHART
SIBLINGS x FRIENDS PALACE
Why you keep attracting the 
wrong people?
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, your Siblings Palace sits directly opposite your Friends Palace.
Which means your energy around siblings, teammates, and close friends is connected —
And the patterns often repeat.
If your childhood was filled with comparison, emotional distance, or pressure to prove…
Those same dynamics may show up in your adult life:
At work. In friendships. Even with your inner circle.

Some people keep attracting energy vampires.
Others always end up being the “giver” with nothing in return.
Some feel unseen, even when they’re constantly there for others.
It’s not just “bad luck with people.”
It’s your unhealed childhood pattern.
And it can block your ability to rise — especially in business or leadership.
Quote
Stop people-pleasing. Start choosing better allies.
Your biggest people problem isn’t about them — it’s your pattern

SAMPLE CHART
SPOUSE x CAREER PALACE
You’re the boss at work, but who are you at home?
Will marrying the right person make your career easier?
Or will finding the right career make your relationship smoother?
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, your Spouse Palace is directly opposite your Career Palace.
Which means your love life and work performance affect each other — a lot.
If you're more easygoing, you'll attract someone stronger.
If you're the one always in control, your partner may turn passive.
It’s not just about personality.
It’s about how two energies interact.
When both sides try to lead — constant power struggle.
When no one leads — nothing moves.
Now think about this:
If you’re the boss at work…
Then also the boss at home…
Where does your partner fit?
Or maybe you’re always accommodating —
At work and in love — and no one steps up.
That’s when both your career and your relationship feel stuck.

SAMPLE CHART
CHILDREN x PROPERTY PALACE
Home isn’t just a place. It’s a pattern.
Always thinking about buying a house?
It might not just be about property — but something deeper.
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, your Children Palace sits directly opposite your Property Palace.
This isn’t just about kids or houses.
It’s about what makes you feel safe, stable, and emotionally secure.

For a child, the most important thing is home —
a place that protects them, grounds them, gives them space to grow.
So if you’re someone who’s always wanted to own a home…
Chances are, it’s not just about real estate.
It’s about healing what you didn’t have growing up —
or protecting the calm you’ve worked so hard to build.
People who are obsessed with house energy…
are usually also the ones who value deep emotional safety, legacy, and loyalty.

Choosing a life partner or business partner?
Watch how they treat their home first.
Here are 4 questions to ask before building anything with someone:
Do they value stability — or chase constant movement?
How do they treat their living space — with care or chaos?
Do they protect what they build — or walk away when it’s inconvenient?
Do they talk about legacy — or just lifestyle?

Home isn’t just where you live. It’s how someone shows you they’re ready to build something that lasts.
Your chart shows exactly what kind of foundation you need —
and who’s safe enough to build it with you.

SAMPLE CHART
WEALTH x WELLBEING PALACE
Why your income is stuck, even if you're working hard?

SAMPLE CHART
PARENTS x HEALTH PALACE
You’re not weak. You’re just carrying more than you should.
Your body remembers what your upbringing tried to hide.
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, your Health Palace sits directly opposite your Parents Palace.
And for once, the old saying is literally true:
“Your body, hair, and skin are gifts from your parents —
honor them as you would honor your lineage.”
But what if that lineage came with pressure, fear, or emotional weight?

How you were raised shapes how you rest.
How you handle pain.
How you deal with pressure.
And how much you allow yourself to break down — or not.
Some people can’t rest because they feel guilty.
Some people hide pain because they were taught breakdown = weakness.
And some people’s sickness didn’t start in the body —
It started with a family script they never questioned.

Here are 3 truths you need to check in with:
Your burnout might be loyalty to someone else’s pain. You saw someone suffer — so you feel you can’t slow down either.
Your perfectionism might be inherited, not chosen. You were wired to perform, not rest. Fix, not feel.
Healing your body might start with forgiving your parents — not blaming them. Letting go doesn’t mean agreeing. It means freeing your system.

Some people inherit land. Some inherit beliefs. And some of us… carry the cost in our body.
Your chart shows what you’re still holding — and how to finally let it go.

Anyone watched football here?

Wealth, Opportunities, Smooth
"Let me explain Lu, Quan, Ke, Ji in a way everyone can understand — using football.
First — Lu. Lu is your striker. This is the guy who scores the goals. When Lu is on your side, opportunities come in smooth, money flows in, and it feels like you’re always at the right place at the right time. Your job? Pass the ball to Lu and let him shoot. Don’t block him.
Then — Quan. Quan is your team captain. He’s got the authority, the power, the control of the field. When Quan is active, you naturally step into leadership roles, people listen to you, and you call the shots. But remember — a captain can lead the team to victory… or to chaos if ego gets in the way.
Next — Ke. Ke is your defender or support system. This is the one who protects your reputation, builds your fame, brings noble people to help you. Ke makes sure you don’t just play the game — you look good doing it. When Ke’s strong, you get backup from the right people at the right time.
And finally — Ji. Ji is your goalkeeper… but here’s the twist — In football, the goalkeeper saves goals. In Zi Wei Dou Shu, Ji is more like the warning sign. It tells you where the leaks are — where money might get lost, where insufficiency happens, where trouble can slip in if you’re not careful. You can’t ignore Ji. If your goalkeeper is weak, even the best striker can’t save the match.
So when you look at your chart — You’re basically looking at your football team. Some people have a killer striker but a shaky goalkeeper — they make money fast but lose it just as fast. Some have a solid captain and defender but no striker — lots of control and reputation, but no real cash flow. Your job is to know your team… and play your strategy right."

Let’s shift gears for a moment. Because what I’m about to say may challenge what you’ve heard before in metaphysics.
Here’s what I believe:
The modern way to read a chart is not to obey it… but to use it. It’s not here to define you. It’s here to accelerate you.
In the old way, people go to a metaphysics consultant and ask: “Can you read my whole life for me?” “Tell me what’s going to happen. What I can or cannot do.” And that’s it — they just listen and follow, like the chart is some fixed instruction manual.
That’s not how we do it here.
We don’t read charts to lock you into a box. We read charts to find leverage. To match the right moves, to the right timing, with the right energy — so you can win faster.

🔁 Don't Match the Chart — Let the Chart Match You
You don’t adjust your whole life just to fit your chart. You adjust the strategy — the angle, the timing, the resource — so your chart works for you.
For example: If your chart shows you're not good with partnerships, It doesn't mean you should never partner with anyone. It means you need to be more selective, set better boundaries, or pick the right timing to partner.
You still lead. The chart just helps you lead smarter.

🔓 The Past Doesn’t Lock You
Whatever patterns you see in your chart — They are not final. They are not curses.
You can always shift your state. And when your state changes, your decisions change. When your decisions change, your reality follows.
So stop letting the past version of you control what’s possible now. You are allowed to evolve — even faster — when you start using your chart as a system.

🎯 Let the Chart Guide Your Goals
The chart isn’t about who you are. It’s about how to get where you want to go — faster.
So the first step is this: Know what your goal is.
Because if you have no direction, your chart can’t help you. But the moment you get clear… The moment you say: “This is where I’m headed” — Your chart becomes a map.
Not to restrict you… but to guide you there with less trial and error.

Set the New Limit (Clear Goals) Just like upgrading your credit card limit — the universe only gives what you apply for. If you never upgraded your goal, why are you shocked you're stuck at 100K and still not fulfilled? This is about certainty, intention, and reprogramming the “goal GPS” before anything else.
Redesign Your Inner Strategy (Energetic Alignment) Metaphysics doesn’t change your life — it reveals who you are. Once your new goal is clear, we align your inner codes (e.g., Wealth Palace, Decision-Maker Type, Collaborator Style) to unlock new behaviors, timing, and flow. This step is about strategy, identity shift, and aligned decision-making.

Why Most People Never Hit Their Goals
Vague Objectives
"Just want to be rich" / "I want more freedom"
Emotion-Based Choices
set goals based on emotion, not strategy or timing
Social Media Copying
Without checking if it's right for their current season
Chart Misalignment
Goals don't match your chart, energy or path"Hard work isn't the problem. Lack of clarity is"

Effective Goal Types
Type
Characteristics
Practical Examples
Short-Term Goals
Specific, measurable targets achievable within 3–12 months that build momentum
Master a valuable skill, earn $1,000 monthly on the side, and build a self-sustaining investment plan.
Long-Term Goals
Transformative visions aligned with core values and life purpose
Achieve complete financial independence, scale business to 7-figures, retire by age 45 with passive income
83

The Key Question
"How do you know if your goal actually fits you?"
84

The Most Dangerous Answer I Keep Hearing
“How much you want to earn?” Most people say: ‘The more the better.’
That’s not a real goal. That’s a wish
RM100K is “more” to some. RM1M still feels “not enough” to others
Missing Clarity
If you can’t define your “more”, how can you ever reach it?
People who say this usually don't know
What they truly want 
What they’ll do with the money 
What timing they’re in
85

Vague goals = Vague results
Purple Star Astrology helps you fix this

Most people don’t fail because the goal is wrong
They fail because the timing is wrong
If This Is What’s Happening in Your Life…
Then Don’t Set This Kind of Goal
Set This Instead
You’re always tired, body in pain, no energy
“I want to make more money”
“I need to fix my health first, then plan money goals”
You just went through a breakup / family problem
“I want to start a business”
“I need to stabilize my emotions and think clearly first”
You feel bored, stuck at work, no progress
“I want to survive this year”
“I want to explore better work / better role / new direction”
You’re always helping others, no time for yourself
“I want to learn 10 new skills”
“I want to create space for me — even just 1 hour a day”
You just moved house / country / job
“I want everything to be stable now”
“Let me adjust slowly — then build my next step clearly”

Destiny Activation
Goals that fulfill life purpose
Let me tell you the truth about goal setting. Most people don’t hit their goals — not because they don’t work hard, But because they set goals disconnected from their destiny.
With Purple Star Astrology, we don’t guess. You’ll know:
Which goals actually match your life system.
Which years to move.
Which years to pause.
And how to activate the exact energy for it.
Once you understand this system, Every goal becomes intentional. Every action has power behind it.

93

Fated Moves vs. Random Goals
"Don't just set goals. Set fated moves."
So here’s the difference.
You can chase random goals like everyone else… Or you can make fated moves.
A fated move means the timing, the chart, the decision — all align. You don’t just want something — you’re meant for it. And once you hit that alignment, you don’t have to force anymore.
That’s the difference between trying to swim upstream… and catching the current that was always meant for you.

94

What one great thing would you dare to dream… 
if you knew you could not fail?
Dream big is not a myth. 
If you knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that you could not fail, what one thing would you set the goal for yourself?
Because sometimes answering that question, will tell you the one thing that you’ve been putting on this earth to accomplish. 

So here’s the difference.
You can chase random goals like everyone else… Or you can make fated moves.
A fated move means the timing, the chart, the decision — all align. You don’t just want something — you’re meant for it. And once you hit that alignment, you don’t have to force anymore.
That’s the difference between trying to swim upstream… and catching the current that was always meant for you.

Day-1 Homework
Bonus Challenge
A simple way to bring your answers to life.
Before we wrap today, I have a bonus challenge for you.
It’s small, simple… but it can create a massive shift over time.
This is your chance to take what you’ve learned today, and bring it to life — not just keep it in your note or in this room, but in a way you can feel and remember for a long time

You’ve just answered some deep questions about your goals and life direction. Now…let’s try expressing one of them out loud
Hear your own clarity
Build conviction in your answers
Remember what truly matters to you

That’s why today, we’re going to capture your thoughts on video, just you, speaking from the heart.
Today, we’ve uncovered some powerful truths about your goals and your direction. It’s one thing to write them down — but speaking them out loud is a completely different energy. When you speak, three things happen:
You hear your own clarity.
You start believing your own words.
You remember what actually matters to you.
That’s why today, I want you to capture your thoughts on video — just you, speaking from the heart. No pressure, no perfect device, no perfect script. Just you."


And imagine this, 1 year from now,you watch this short clip back…
You’ll see your starting point.
You’ll feel the difference in your energy.
You’ll realise how far you’ve come.

Now, imagine this… one year from today, you press play on this short clip.
You see your starting point.
You feel how your energy has changed.
You realise — wow — look how far I’ve come.
This is going to be more than just a video.
It’s going to be a time capsule… proof of your own growth.

Here’s simple challenge
Who are you, and what do you do?
Why do you want to learn Purple Star Astrology?
If you could only achieve ONE thing in the next 12 months… what would actually make you proud?
Record a 1-minute selfie video answering it…  as if you’re talking to a close friend.
Why is this goal important to you?
Tonight, I don’t want you to just sleep. I want you to go through this 1-minute challenge Because what you’ve been calling “goals”… Might actually be compensation for something deeper.
So here’s what I want you to do.. Ask yourself:
What goal have you been chasing… but deep down, it’s not flowing?
What part of you feels like it’s still proving something to someone?
If you could only achieve one thing in the next 12 months — what would actually make you proud?
Then, record a one-minute selfie video answering it — as if you’re talking to a close friend.
This isn’t for me, this is for you. I mean you don’t have to send it to me, but if you want - i dont mind haha, i would love to celebrate your journey with you. But anyhow Keep it for yourself. Just you versus the real you.

— CAE, International Destiny Strategist
“Alright, welcome back everyone. Good to see all of you here for Day 2.”
“I appreciate all of you showing up again — it says a lot about your commitment to improving your life.”
“Yesterday was a long session, but many of you were still thinking about your chart afterwards — that’s the momentum we want.”“A lot of people attend classes just to ‘listen’. But the ones who actually think, reflect, and process… those are the ones who change fastest.”
“Quick check — who relooked at your chart or reflect on what you learned yesterday? Type ME.” “Okay good, I see many of you. That already puts you ahead of most people who just close the Zoom and forget everything.”
“And yes, we ended yesterday with a simple one-minute video challenge.”
“Some of you messaged me saying it felt uncomfortable — that’s exactly the point. Growth never feels comfortable in the beginning.”
“I saw some of your submissions — very real, very honest. That exercise wasn’t just homework; it helps you see your own direction clearly.”
“When you can state your goal clearly, your chart becomes 10 times more useful, because now we know what to align it with.”
“Today we move from awareness… to clarity… to strategy.”
“Awareness tells you who you are. Clarity tells you where you’re going. Strategy tells you what to actually do next.”
“Most people only have awareness, but they never reach clarity. That’s why their life feels ‘stuck’.”
“By the end of today, you’ll know what actually matters — and what doesn’t.”
“You’ll stop wasting time on things that are not aligned with your timing. So You’ll know what decisions to prioritise, and what you can safely ignore.”
“Alright, let’s dive in.”
“Make sure you have your notes ready — today we will connect everything from yesterday.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
1
Read Your Chart With A Purpose
If you don’t set a goal, it’s like driving a car without a steering wheel — you’ll just get lost.
2
Adjust Your Strategy
Zi Wei exists to give you clarity. Adjust Your Path 
Intelligently.
3
Keep An Empty-Cup Mindset
Don’t pretend to be smart. Come in with an empty cup. 
Explore Your Potential & Possibilities.
4
Help & Empower Others
Good Heart = Good Luck. Guide and empower, do GOOD only. 
“And finally — once you learn this, use it responsibly.
If you look at someone’s chart and you see they are in a 平平清云 year, you don’t need to tell them, ‘Oh, you’re unlucky, you’ll lose money, you’re going to fail.’ That only creates fear.
Instead, you can say, ‘This is a year to stay steady. Focus on your skills. Strengthen your career foundation. Build what you can control.’
Because remember: 运是思维 — your luck follows your thinking. If you plant fear in someone’s mind, they’ll live fearfully. But if you guide them with clarity, they can make wiser choices and create better outcomes.
Zi Wei is not about predicting doom. It’s about empowering people — giving them direction, confidence, and the ability to make better decisions.
And this is exactly the same for you.
I’m not here over these 3 days to scare you, or to give you some vague predictions. I’m here to give you clarity, strategy, and tools you can actually use.

EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON
YIN YANG =
The law of balance
The law of karma
The law of truth
☯ What Is Yin Yang — Really?
People always say…“Everything happens for a reason.”
But have you ever stopped to ask:What does that actually mean?
It’s not just a motivational quote.It’s a universal law.
In Zi Wei Dou Shu, we call it: 因果定律 — the Law of Cause and Effect. Or simply put: Yin Yang.
Now I know what you’re thinking —“Isn’t that some spiritual or Chinese thing?”Not really.
Yin Yang isn’t religious. It’s not about belief. It’s just how the universe works.
Every up has a down. Every action has a reaction. Every seed you plant… eventually becomes a harvest.
🌱 Maybe years ago, you planted a seed — A belief you never questioned. A pattern you kept repeating. A decision you made out of fear, habit, or pressure.
🌳 And now, you’re just living the harvest of it.
That’s Yin Yang: The law of balance, The law of karma, The law of truth — whether you believe it or not.
That’s why Zi Wei Dou Shu is so powerful. It doesn’t just “predict” your future.
It helps you connect the dots backwards — to understand why things happened the way they did.
Every palace. Every star. Every transformation. They’re not random. They’re karmic receipts — showing you what chapter of life is trying to teach you something.

🧠 But I’m Not Here Just to Read Your Fate.
I’m here to help you rewrite your cause.
Because once you see the pattern... Once you understand the effect you’re stuck in... You can finally plant a new cause — with intention.
🌕 That’s the real meaning of Yin Yang. It’s not just balance. It’s motion. It’s choice. It’s the idea that even your darkest cycle… contains the spark of a turnaround.
But only if you’re willing to trace the root — and choose again.



听起来好像很玄
大家进来学习一定是要变得越来越好
每个人一定有好的一面，也有坏的一面

凡是发生都有利于我

修行者，身心灵学问，你要把好的坏的，都当成是【补药】
吃亏当吃补的意思

WHAT IS CONTROLLING YOUR 
"YIN" & "YANG"?
114

EMOTION BALANCE
YANG
POSITIVITY
YIN
NEGATIVITY
☯ Yin Yang Isn’t Just Energy — It’s Emotion. Everything is about balancing 
Let’s get real for a second.
Yin represents the “negative” side — sadness, tiredness, fear, doubt. Yang represents the “positive” — confidence, joy, drive, clarity.
But most people misunderstand this. They think being “spiritual” means they always have to be calm and positive. That’s not true.
Yin and Yang are not enemies. They’re a cycle.
Yes — you’ll have days when you’re off. Yes — you’ll feel frustrated, stuck, angry, hopeless.
But here’s the real question: Do you stay there?
Or do you shift?
And this is where the real game begins. It’s not about avoiding Yin or chasing Yang — both will come, whether you like it or not. The real question is… what do you do when the Yin hits?
Do you freeze? Do you fight? Or do you turn it into fuel? Because that one choice… decides whether you stay stuck where you are, or break into a whole new level.
Let me show you exactly what I mean

You’re focusing others more than yourself
When your boss tell you to be on time for a meeting at 1pm, youre gonna be on time or maybe even earlier than that. When your lover ask you for a date night, youre gonna plan everything well for him/her
But when it comes to yourself, like you promised yourself you wanna go to the gym this saturday at 10am. But that morning, when you wake up at 7am, you’re gonna be like “fuck this shit, im tired from the weekend work, im gonna skip the workout”
The problem here is, you're treating others better than you treat yourself, although you know its important to lets say your health.

If you’re looking for mentor, support, growth or breakthrough, then you refer to your Life Palace and Travel Palace. These two tell you who will open your path and expand your worldview.
If you want inner peace or more happiness, you check your Health Palace and Wellbeing Palace. Because peace is an internal experience, not an external one.
If your goal is career advancement, promotion or achievement, then your answer is always in the Career Palace.
If you’re focusing on wealth, assets, or investments, then you check both your Wealth Palace and your Property Palace. Wealth creation and asset growth come from these two combined.
For collaboration, partnership, colleagues, you refer to your Friends Palace — this shows who will work with you, support you, or block you.
To understand your relationship with bosses, managers, elders, you go to the Parents Palace — because this represents authority, guidance, and people above you.
If your objective is love, marriage, or peach blossom luck, that’s your Spouse Palace.

Of course can.
But the key is: Identify your objectives first.
Once you know what you want, your chart will never confuse you again — because each objective will point you to the correct Palace automatically.
The challenge is not reading the chart. The challenge is knowing what you’re solving.
When your objective is clear, the Palaces you need to use become very obvious.

"Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power." 
— Lao Tsu
How many of you have spent your whole life… devoting your time, your energy, your emotions — to take care of your family… your spouse… your kids… even your siblings or colleagues…
But when it comes to you — there’s always “no time”?
We were taught that being a good person means putting others first. So we take responsibility for everything. Until one day… you start burning out. You don’t even feel like yourself anymore. You just want to escape.
But what if I told you — there’s a system that can flip that story?
A system that shows you the right direction in life — like finally sitting in the driver’s seat… but this time, with a GPS.
A system that shows you when to move, how to move, and how to gain back control of your life. So you don’t just survive — you thrive… with peace, alignment… and wealth.
Because like Lao Tzu once said: “Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.”
So let me ask you — how many of you want to finally step into that power?

IF THIS EVER CROSSED YOUR MIND…

📊 Are you better with clear systems or messy trial-and-error?

📊 Do you work best with SOPs or by improvising?

📊 Can you turn chaos into an organised plan?

📊 Big Corporate or small SME? Leader or follower?

⭐ Zi Wei (Emperor Star) Star of Authority & Control
🎙️ Full Script: Zi Wei Star – 12 Palaces Breakdown
Let’s walk through how the Zi Wei (Emperor Star) behaves in all 12 palaces — and why this star is one of the clearest indicators of structure, status, and responsibility in a person’s life.

🏛️ Life Palace
If Zi Wei sits in your Life Palace, you naturally carry a strong, commanding energy. You don’t wait for others to lead — you just do it. You may not even realize how intense you come across, but people can feel your structure, your standards, and your sense of control. You're not the “go with the flow” type — you're the “let’s get this done” type.

💰 Wealth Palace
In the Wealth Palace, Zi Wei shows someone who earns through career and competence. You don’t attract “easy money” — you build it. Your wealth often comes from taking on roles with responsibility, leadership, or expertise. If you work hard and stay consistent, money naturally follows.

🏢 Career Palace
This is Zi Wei’s favorite throne. When placed here, you shine in work environments — especially when there's structure, hierarchy, or a clear mission. You’re often trusted by bosses or placed in roles with visibility. Careers in government, real estate, tech, jewelry, watches, or anything high-end and professional — suit you well. You don’t just do a job. You own the space.

👬 Siblings Palace
Among your siblings, you may be the dominant one — or feel responsible for them. You either lead, manage, or feel like the one holding things together in the family dynamic. This can build respect — or distance, depending on how you express it.

❤️ Spouse Palace
If Zi Wei is here, your partner tends to be strong, independent, or even controlling. They might be ambitious, or very fixed in their opinions. For some, this placement brings delayed marriage — not because love isn’t present, but because both partners have strong energy and don’t compromise easily.

👶 Children Palace
Zi Wei in the Children Palace creates kids who are disciplined, bossy, or independent. They may want to control things from a young age, or grow up to become leaders themselves. You may find parenting requires you to negotiate power — not just guide it.

👫 Friends Palace
In your social circle, Zi Wei attracts high-quality connections — people who are managers, CEOs, or very serious about their careers. You don’t mix with everyone — you mix with those who move with intention.

👴 Parents Palace
This often points to parents who were strict, structured, or placed high expectations on you. You may have grown up feeling like you needed to “be responsible” early, or carry their standards even as an adult.

🩺 Health (Illness) Palace
Zi Wei in this palace points to potential stomach-related issues, or what we call “rich-person illnesses” — meaning, problems related to stress, lifestyle, or long-term pressure. You're not weak — but when your body collapses, it's usually from overdoing, not under-doing.

💫 Spiritual Palace (Mental/Emotional)
This placement shows someone who’s competitive, ambitious, and rarely shuts off. It’s hard for you to truly relax — because the mind is always thinking about what’s next. Even when things are going well, part of you might still feel like it’s not enough. You’re hard on others — but even harder on yourself.

✈️ Travel Palace
You often prefer to travel alone, or take the lead during trips. Even when you’re outside your comfort zone, you still like to stay in control. You don't follow — you plan, lead, and make things happen.

🏡 Property Palace
This is one of the strongest placements for real estate potential. Zi Wei here suggests you’ll either own property, or have the mindset to secure long-term assets. You value stability — and a physical space that reflects your status.

🔚 Final Thought
Zi Wei is not a soft star. It doesn’t care if you feel ready — it expects you to rise.
So if you carry this star, anywhere in your key palaces — know this: You were built to lead. But your biggest challenge? Isn’t capability. It’s balancing power with presence.
Lead, but don’t isolate. Command, but stay connected. That’s how a true emperor evolves.

⭐ Lian Zhen (Commander Star) Star of Discipline & Structure
Palace
Key Meaning 
Life
Follows systems, prefers order; disciplined but may appear cold or rigid
Wealth
Earns through admin, ops, SOPs; stable, structured money habits
Career
Enforces rules, deadlines; excels in law, planning, technology, agriculture, plantation
LIFE PALACE If you have Lian Zhen here, your life path is deeply tied to systems, routines, and doing things the “proper” way. You’re the kind who thrives on structure — but to others, it can come off as cold, overly disciplined, or hard to connect with. Just remember: your strength is precision, not popularity.

WEALTH PALACE You don’t gamble for riches — you build it brick by brick. Admin work, operations, anything that runs on SOPs? That’s your money zone. You’re not flashy, but your financial system is solid — and that’s exactly what keeps the income flowing.

CAREER PALACE In the workplace, you are the rule enforcer. Deadlines, policies, systems — you keep things in check. You shine in law, planning, digital systems, or even agriculture where order is key. You’re not the loudest leader, but your results are undeniable.

SIBLINGS PALACE You naturally respect hierarchy. You look up to elders and quietly protect those younger than you. You believe in “do your part” — and expect others to do theirs too.

SPOUSE PALACE Very traditional energy here. If you're female, you lean toward homemaking roles. If you're male, you carry the role of provider seriously. It’s not about gender — it’s about roles being clearly defined.

CHILDREN PALACE You’re likely to have a son first. Your kids won’t be wild — they’ll be independent, neat, and systematic… just like you. Your parenting style? Structure with love.

FRIENDS PALACE You’re not the “bestie on day one” type. It takes time for you to warm up. But when you finally open up — you’re loyal, grounded, and solid.

PARENTS PALACE Your upbringing had its structure. Maybe not always emotional — but things were stable. Rules were clear. And that gave you your current backbone.

HEALTH PALACE Lian Zhen rules blood, so circulation issues may come up. Watch your pressure, your diet, and stay moving.

WELLBEING PALACE Mentally, you’re stable — but don’t over-rigidify your thinking. Structure helps… until it traps you.

TRAVEL PALACE You like predictability. You don’t “travel for chaos.” You prefer to revisit familiar places, stay on routine, and avoid unnecessary surprises.

PROPERTY PALACE You don’t chase mansions from day one. You grow step-by-step: from condo to landed, to double storey, and maybe bungalow one day. Slow, steady, and sustainable wins your property game.

You’re the kind who thrives on structure — but to others, it can come off as cold, overly disciplined, or hard to connect with. Just remember: your strength is precision, not popularity.

WEALTH PALACE You don’t gamble for riches — you build it brick by brick. Admin work, operations, anything that runs on SOPs? That’s your money zone. You’re not flashy, but your financial system is solid — and that’s exactly what keeps the income flowing.

CAREER PALACE In the workplace, you are the rule enforcer. Deadlines, policies, systems — you keep things in check. You shine in law, planning, digital systems, or even agriculture where order is key. You’re not the loudest leader, but your results are undeniable.

SIBLINGS PALACE You naturally respect hierarchy. You look up to elders and quietly protect those younger than you. You believe in “do your part” — and expect others to do theirs too.

SPOUSE PALACE Very traditional energy here. If you're female, you lean toward homemaking roles. If you're male, you carry the role of provider seriously. It’s not about gender — it’s about roles being clearly defined.

CHILDREN PALACE You’re likely to have a son first. Your kids won’t be wild — they’ll be independent, neat, and systematic… just like you. Your parenting style? Structure with love.

FRIENDS PALACE You’re not the “bestie on day one” type. It takes time for you to warm up. But when you finally open up — you’re loyal, grounded, and solid.

PARENTS PALACE Your upbringing had its structure. Maybe not always emotional — but things were stable. Rules were clear. And that gave you your current backbone.

HEALTH PALACE Lian Zhen rules blood, so circulation issues may come up. Watch your pressure, your diet, and stay moving.

WELLBEING PALACE Mentally, you’re stable — but don’t over-rigidify your thinking. Structure helps… until it traps you.

TRAVEL PALACE You like predictability. You don’t “travel for chaos.” You prefer to revisit familiar places, stay on routine, and avoid unnecessary surprises.

PROPERTY PALACE You don’t chase mansions from day one. You grow step-by-step: from condo to landed, to double storey, and maybe bungalow one day. Slow, steady, and sustainable wins your property game.

Key Meaning
Life
Old-soul thinker; traditional, strategic, long-lived
Wealth
Service, consultant roles; earns by helping others
Career
Prefers leadership roles; guides, mentors, protects
⭐ Tian Liang (Star of Legacy & Protection) Old soul. Long game player. The second-in-command that runs the show.
This star is slow to act but hard to replace. Once it’s in a palace, that area becomes 守住的 — well-guarded, long-lasting, and full of wisdom.
This star got activation of fortune, power and status, but no obstacles ya  Now let’s break it down palace by palace:

🏠 Life Palace
You were never the impulsive type. You think twice, maybe three times, before making a move. People might call you 老成 — but that’s because you’re carrying experience others don’t have. You don’t fight to be number one… but in the end, everyone still listens to you.
Hua Lu: You love showing off your knowledge. Sharing ideas, quoting books, becoming the “encyclopedia” of your group.
Hua Quan: Leadership comes naturally — not by shouting, but by presence. People respect how you guide with maturity.
Hua Ke: You carry prestige. Not loud, not flashy — but people know your name. You earn titles, trust, and long-term recognition.

💰 Wealth Palace
You’re not someone who chases fast money. You build wealth by serving — through consulting, helping, healing. Suitable for public sector, advisory roles, or any field where 经验 is monetized.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
You thrive in environments where you can 照顾人 or 建立制度. You’re not the aggressive CEO, but you’re the trusted director, the steady VP. People come to you when they want things done right, not just fast.

🧒 Siblings Palace
Even if you’re not the eldest, you play the elder role. You’re the stabilizer in the family — the one who doesn’t overreact, the one who thinks long-term. You carry the “老二当家” spirit — supportive, but powerful.

💍 Spouse Palace
You naturally attract older, more mature partners. Or — you yourself prefer relationships that feel safe and emotionally intelligent. You don’t chase romance… you build trust.

👶 Children Palace
Your children (or your juniors/students) tend to act mature. They may be young in age but old in soul — sharp minds, deep thinkers, sometimes even smarter than you in certain areas.

👫 Friends Palace
You don’t just hang with peers. Many of your best friends are much older or younger. You value depth of connection more than similarity in age. You’re the type to have a tea buddy in his 60s and a mentee in her 20s — and you get along with both.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
Your father (or father figure) may live long or leave behind a strong legacy. This placement often indicates a traditional upbringing — where moral values and cultural teachings play a big part.

🏥 Health Palace
Tian Liang doesn’t bring frequent sickness — but when illness comes, it lingers. Watch out for long-term issues like rheumatism, arthritis, or chronic fatigue. Prevention is your best friend.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You find peace in “old things.” Tea, antiques, books, history — anything that feels timeless gives you joy. Your inner world is rich and reflective. Don’t let people rush your process.

✈️ Travel Palace
You’re not the backpacker type. You like to go to the same places, again and again. Familiarity = peace. Your kind of travel is: go to the same café, sit there 4 hours, drink tea, maybe don’t even talk much.
Hua Ke: Can go out for hours and not return. Especially if you have 文昌、文曲、左辅、右弼 — you won’t leave till you’ve explored everything. Even food court close also never mind.
Hua Quan: Loves going out, but with control. Long hours outside, but purposeful movement.
No Four Transformations: Default mode = loyalty to your spots. You find your few favourites, and you stick to them.

🏡 Property Palace
You don’t buy dreams. You buy what you can see, touch, and confirm. Pre-built, second-hand, or proven properties are your thing. Showroom empty, you don’t buy. Must feel it first.

Life Palace You’re someone who thinks fast, moves fast, and acts on instinct. If you’re on the shorter side, you probably hear this a lot: “Wah, your brain damn fast one.” You’re not the type to sit still — your mind is always calculating something, trying to connect dots others don’t see. But if you don’t give yourself space to slow down, you’ll end up overthinking and second-guessing everything.
Wealth Palace Your money is constantly in motion. You might be the type who earns fast… but also spends fast. If you don’t have a proper system, you’ll keep wondering: “How come I work so hard but still no savings?” The secret isn’t to slow down — it’s to learn how to manage flow. You can be rich, but only if you control the traffic of your finances.
Career Palace Tian Ji excels at planning, brainstorming, and solving problems. You’re not meant for brute force or repetitive jobs — you shine where strategy is needed. Think roles like planner, tech, digital marketing, systems builder, teacher, advisor. You’ll rise faster if your job lets you move and think freely.
Siblings Palace You and your siblings probably talk a lot — sometimes even debate a lot. You may have grown up feeling like you had to compete for attention, which made you more independent. But deep down, you’re still the one they come to for advice.
Spouse Palace When it comes to love, Tian Ji is always evolving. You may experience a few breakups before finding someone who can keep up with your pace. You don’t do well with boring relationships — you need mental stimulation, deep conversation, and someone who understands your need for freedom.
Children Palace You’re likely to have sons first, or kids who are mentally sharp and quick-witted. But don’t expect them to follow instructions blindly — they’re like mini yous: smart, independent, and full of opinions.
Friends Palace You attract many friends around your age. You love exchanging ideas, exploring new plans, and starting random side projects together. Just be careful not to overpromise or jump from group to group too fast.
Parents Palace Your parents likely encouraged you to learn, read, explore — but they also might have shifted houses or schools when you were young. This gave you early exposure to change and taught you to adapt fast.
Health Palace Tian Ji rules the limbs and heart — so watch your circulation, overexertion, or issues with your hands and feet. When your mind is too active, your body might pay the price.
Wellbeing Palace You process things very quickly, which means you’re also prone to mental stress. Your peace doesn’t come from silence — it comes from clarity. Get your thoughts in order, and your whole body will thank you.
Travel Palace You’re made for movement. Whether it’s by car, train, boat, or plane — you love new environments and switching things up. If you’re stuck in one place too long, your energy will drop.
Property Palace You’re not the type to buy a mansion out of ego. You prefer smaller, practical spaces — as long as they’re ready, clean, and easy to move into. Efficiency is your comfort.

🗣️ Script Pointers:
“Now, let’s move into the second wealth code — the investment brain
“These stars don’t like guessing. They want to see the numbers— before they move.”
 and this one might look similar to Strategy Planner at first…
But here’s the key difference:
👉 Strategy Planners lead with the head — they love planning, managing, building systems.
👉 Investment Brain types lead with financial instinct. They don’t always need to plan 10 steps ahead — but they’re very sharp when it comes to money flow, stability, and timing.
These are the people who don’t overthink — they just ask: ‘Got profit or not?’ ‘Can hold long-term or not?’
They grow wealth through assets, savings, careful decisions, and consistent action. They may move slower — but every move is measured.
They don’t need to manage big teams or build complicated systems. Sometimes, just controlling their cashflow, holding good assets, and being consistent… is already enough to win.”
“If this is your wealth code — don’t let fast-talkers distract you. Stick to your cashflow, and let your numbers win.”

⭐ Wu Qu (Warrior Star) Star of Wealth & Precision
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Money-minded, practical, cold-faced; strong cheekbones, serious vibe
Wealth
Best placement; natural money-maker, investment & finance
Career
Suited for finance, metal, production, insurance, retails
⭐ Wu Qu (Star of Wealth & Precision) Big Money Star. Emotionally cold, but financially hot.
Wu Qu is not here to feel. It’s here to count. This is the true “财神” of the chart — if you’re carrying Wu Qu energy, you were born to handle money, manage numbers, and make it real.
🧍 If Wu Qu is in Life Palace:
You were born with a calculator in your head. Everything you do is measured, strategic — and usually connected to money. Even your face gives it away: strong cheekbones, sharp edges, not here to sayang, here to settle.
Emotionally? A bit冷酷.
Mentally? Super clear.
Energetically? Magnetic to cash — if you trust your own system.

💰 If Wu Qu is in Wealth Palace:
Chef’s kiss. This is one of the best Wu Qu placements. You don’t chase money. Money finds you — especially if you stay consistent and keep your numbers tight.
With Hua Lu: Game over. You might not even need a job — investments, systems, or one deal can fund your life.
But don’t get greedy. Wu Qu’s wealth works best when you treat it like a discipline, not a gamble.

🧑‍💼 If Wu Qu is in Career Palace:
Think metal, numbers, structure, systems. You do well in:
Banking, finance, accounting
Insurance, procurement, engineering
Factory, manufacturing, metals & machinery
You want order. You respect results. You don't care for sugarcoating — just show the figures.

🧒 Siblings Palace:
Your siblings may be more like business partners than emotional cheerleaders. They’re stable, realistic — and may even help manage family money, assets, or responsibilities.

💍 Spouse Palace:
Marriage tends to come later. Not because you can’t find someone — but because you’re not rushing. You don’t fall for vibes. You fall for someone who can build with you.

👶 Children Palace:
Daughters first is more likely. And you might treat your children like mini-adults — teaching them to be independent, strong, and self-managing from young.

👫 Friends Palace:
Your circle? Solid. You attract friends who are money-capable, grounded, and practical. These are the type of people who talk opportunities, not gossip. Just be careful not to turn every friendship into a transaction.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace:
You were likely raised with structure. Whether strict, conservative, or just “don’t waste” type of family — you learned early on how to plan, save, and not depend on others emotionally.

🏥 Health Palace:
Your vulnerable spots:
Nose (respiratory system),
Lungs, joints, bones (especially knees),
Can also be prone to injuries related to stiffness or overwork.
You don’t fall sick easily — but when you do, it’s usually from pushing too hard.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace:
You don’t really “relax.” Even when you rest, your mind is planning the next step. You need peace through clarity — not chaos. Best recharge methods: writing, investing time in something measurable, or… cleaning.

✈️ Travel Palace:
You don’t go out for fun. If you leave the house, it’s for money.
Especially if Wu Qu is paired with Qi Sha — This combo = “出门只为钱.” You’re built for foreign markets, overseas deals, or international trading.

🏡 Property Palace:
You don’t just earn. You save. Wu Qu here means your money always finds its way home — whether it’s property, deposits, or gold bars. This is a sign of good long-term wealth accumulation.

⭐ Wu Qu (Star of Wealth & Precision) Big Money Star. Emotionally cold, but financially hot.
Wu Qu is not here to feel. It’s here to count. This is the true “财神” of the chart — if you’re carrying Wu Qu energy, you were born to handle money, manage numbers, and make it real.
🧍 If Wu Qu is in Life Palace:
You were born with a calculator in your head. Everything you do is measured, strategic — and usually connected to money. Even your face gives it away: strong cheekbones, sharp edges, not here to sayang, here to settle.
Emotionally? A bit冷酷.
Mentally? Super clear.
Energetically? Magnetic to cash — if you trust your own system.

💰 If Wu Qu is in Wealth Palace:
Chef’s kiss. This is one of the best Wu Qu placements. You don’t chase money. Money finds you — especially if you stay consistent and keep your numbers tight.
With Hua Lu: Game over. You might not even need a job — investments, systems, or one deal can fund your life.
But don’t get greedy. Wu Qu’s wealth works best when you treat it like a discipline, not a gamble.

🧑‍💼 If Wu Qu is in Career Palace:
Think metal, numbers, structure, systems. You do well in:
Banking, finance, accounting
Insurance, procurement, engineering
Factory, manufacturing, metals & machinery
You want order. You respect results. You don't care for sugarcoating — just show the figures.

🧒 Siblings Palace:
Your siblings may be more like business partners than emotional cheerleaders. They’re stable, realistic — and may even help manage family money, assets, or responsibilities.

💍 Spouse Palace:
Marriage tends to come later. Not because you can’t find someone — but because you’re not rushing. You don’t fall for vibes. You fall for someone who can build with you.

👶 Children Palace:
Daughters first is more likely. And you might treat your children like mini-adults — teaching them to be independent, strong, and self-managing from young.

👫 Friends Palace:
Your circle? Solid. You attract friends who are money-capable, grounded, and practical. These are the type of people who talk opportunities, not gossip. Just be careful not to turn every friendship into a transaction.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace:
You were likely raised with structure. Whether strict, conservative, or just “don’t waste” type of family — you learned early on how to plan, save, and not depend on others emotionally.

🏥 Health Palace:
Your vulnerable spots:
Nose (respiratory system),
Lungs, joints, bones (especially knees),
Can also be prone to injuries related to stiffness or overwork.
You don’t fall sick easily — but when you do, it’s usually from pushing too hard.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace:
You don’t really “relax.” Even when you rest, your mind is planning the next step. You need peace through clarity — not chaos. Best recharge methods: writing, investing time in something measurable, or… cleaning.

✈️ Travel Palace:
You don’t go out for fun. If you leave the house, it’s for money.
Especially if Wu Qu is paired with Qi Sha — This combo = “出门只为钱.” You’re built for foreign markets, overseas deals, or international trading.

🏡 Property Palace:
You don’t just earn. You save. Wu Qu here means your money always finds its way home — whether it’s property, deposits, or gold bars. This is a sign of good long-term wealth accumulation.

⭐ Tian Fu (Builder Star) Star of Stability & Fortune Vault
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Gentle, conservative, well-fed; full of knowledge and fortune luck
Wealth
Stable and traditional; if local market fails, go abroad
Career
Suits real estate, insurance, agriculture, farming, civil service
⭐ Tian Fu (Star of Stability & the Wealth Vault) This is the banker. The steward. The one who builds empires slowly, but solidly.
If Wu Qu is the one hunting for money, Tian Fu is the one keeping it safe.

🏠 Life Palace
You’re calm. Measured. Structured. Not the wild, flashy type — but the one everyone trusts when things go wrong. Your energy is stable, your thoughts are grounded, and yes — people with this star often gain weight easily. Because Tian Fu = abundance. In food, in money, in presence.
People feel safe around you. And you need to feel secure before taking any big step.

💰 Wealth Palace
You don’t chase fast money. You prefer slow, steady income — even if it takes longer to build. You’re good with property, fixed investments, long-term projects, and conservative money moves.
But here’s the key: If you’re not making money in your local environment, don’t wait. Tian Fu needs fertile ground — and that might be overseas, or in foreign markets.
The moment you sell to foreigners or enter a new land — your fortune activates.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
You’re the stabilizer in any workplace. You don’t need to be the CEO — you’re often the trusted No.2. The operations head, the system builder, the one who makes sure nothing falls apart.
You do best in stable industries:
Property
Agriculture
Hospitality
Civil service
Food & beverage
Anything long-term, safe, and predictable
You can stay in the same job for 10–20 years and be completely fine. Because you value peace more than excitement.

🧒 Siblings Palace
You naturally respect your elder siblings or authority figures. You don’t like conflict — you like harmony. If your siblings are chaotic, you’ll be the one trying to restore order.

💍 Spouse Palace
You’re traditional in love. You prefer a loyal, family-oriented partner who stays. You may also have a slight need to control — not in a toxic way, but because you want to protect what you built.
If you’re a man: you’ll attract someone who’s a homemaker, gentle, and supportive.
If you’re a woman: you may marry a strong, traditional man who takes charge — sometimes even a little bossy.

👶 Children Palace
You’re the type who plans everything: Marriage first, then kids — and even the order of the children matters to you.
Often: son first, then daughter. You raise your kids with structure, rules, and responsibility. You don’t “wing it” — you guide them step by step.

👫 Friends Palace
You stick to the same group of friends for years. You’re not into making new friends every weekend. You value loyalty, shared values, and depth — not trend-based friendships.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
You were raised traditionally — especially by your father. He may have been a man of principle, values, or strong family morals. This is a chart that values filial piety — even if you disagree, you don’t want to disappoint your parents.

🏥 Health Palace
Your weak spot is the digestive system — stomach, spleen, gut health. You may find yourself eating too much when stressed or anxious.
Tian Fu is like “dry earth” — it always needs nutrients. Which means… you’ll always be tempted to snack, even when you’re not hungry.
Watch your weight and gut inflammation — these will creep in if you’re not careful.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You feel at peace when your world is in order. You don’t enjoy chaos, you don’t need adrenaline — you just want to feel safe and steady.
You relax through routines, familiar places, slow-paced hobbies like cooking, gardening, organizing. And yes — you’re probably the kind of person who finds cleaning… therapeutic.

✈️ Travel Palace
If your hometown doesn’t reward you financially, leave. Tian Fu shines in foreign markets. You’re built for overseas business, international sales, or foreign partnerships.
You don’t love to travel for fun — but you’ll travel for growth. And when you do, it’ll pay off long-term.

🏡 Property Palace
You don’t buy what’s still under construction. You buy what’s done, what’s ready, what you can see and touch.
You don’t like promises. You want results. You’re the type who walks into a show unit and says: “If I can move in next month — I’ll take it.”

⭐ Tai Yin (Star of Soft Power & Feminine Wealth) This is the moonlight star. Quiet, magnetic, emotionally rich.
You don’t lead by force. You lead by presence. Wherever Tai Yin sits, there’s subtle control. Beautiful, soft, but never weak.

🏠 Life Palace
You’re charming without trying. You walk into a room — people notice. Not because you're loud, but because you have a magnetic softness.

With Hua Ke: elegant, intelligent, attractive — people respect your presence. With Hua Ji: love triangles, secret relationships, or “mistress energy” can appear — be careful who you fall for.

Your children are sensitive, emotional, and possibly artistic. They need emotional security more than strict rules. You may have to guide them through emotional ups and downs — especially if you’re raising girls.

👫 Friends Palace

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
The mother figure is strong here. You may have grown up in a home where emotions, appearance, or "keeping peace" mattered a lot. You learned early how to navigate tension with silence or charm.

🏥 Health Palace
Your sensitive spots:
Liver
Water retention
Hormonal or reproductive system

With Hua Ke: once you go out, you disappear for hours. You want to explore everything. With Hua Ji: travel can lead to emotional drama — especially with people. With strong supportive stars (Wen Chang, Wen Qu, Zuo Fu, You Bi): you won’t leave a mall until you’ve seen every shop.

🏡 Property Palace
You don’t just live in one place. You accumulate homes, land, or inheritance over time. This is a “landlord star.” You may end up owning more property than you expected.

⭐ Tai Yin (Star of Soft Power & Feminine Wealth) This is the moonlight star. Quiet, magnetic, emotionally rich.
You don’t lead by force. You lead by presence. Wherever Tai Yin sits, there’s subtle control. Beautiful, soft, but never weak.

🏠 Life Palace
You’re charming without trying. You walk into a room — people notice. Not because you're loud, but because you have a magnetic softness.
If you’re female: Tai Yin here gives elegance, grace, and often... full features (yes, including the chest).
If you’re male: this gives strong peach blossom luck — women are drawn to you naturally.
With Hua Ke: elegant, intelligent, attractive — people respect your presence. With Hua Ji: love triangles, secret relationships, or “mistress energy” can appear — be careful who you fall for.

💰 Wealth Palace
This is a strong placement. Tai Yin is a money magnet — but not through hustle. It attracts wealth passively:
Through investments
Real estate
Beauty, branding, or feminine industries
Or simply by aligning with the right people
You don’t chase money. It comes when you’re in the right environment.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
You’re not the loud manager — you’re the refined professional. You thrive in:
Branding and beauty
Finance or banking
Elegant services (jewelry, skincare, luxury)
Quiet leadership or behind-the-scenes support
You lead with trust, not noise. And your best roles are ones where presentation, design, or discretion matter.

🧒 Siblings Palace
You likely have more sisters — or more feminine siblings. Even if you have brothers, you may still feel closer to the women in your family.
You naturally take on the role of emotional listener or mediator.

💍 Spouse Palace
You attract partners who value freedom. This can mean:
Partners who travel a lot
Emotionally distant types
Or people who don’t want to be “tied down” easily
With Hua Lu: your husband may have many women — or too many options. If you’re same-sex attracted, this can bring high peach blossom — but also love complications. With Hua Ji: be cautious of being the second choice… or becoming someone’s “other person.”

👶 Children Palace
Your children are sensitive, emotional, and possibly artistic. They need emotional security more than strict rules. You may have to guide them through emotional ups and downs — especially if you’re raising girls.

👫 Friends Palace
You have a big circle — mostly women, and mostly chatty. Yes, gossip is part of it. You attract talkative, emotional, or expressive friends — but some may also be overly sensitive or draining. Choose wisely.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
The mother figure is strong here. You may have grown up in a home where emotions, appearance, or "keeping peace" mattered a lot. You learned early how to navigate tension with silence or charm.

🏥 Health Palace
Your sensitive spots:
Liver
Water retention
Hormonal or reproductive system
Anything related to fluids in the body
For women: PMS, irregular cycles, or gynecological issues may show up. For both: stress goes straight to the stomach and liver.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You’re emotionally deep. You pick up energies easily. You need alone time to reset. When overwhelmed, you may shut down or retreat.
You don’t do well in harsh environments — you need softness around you to function at your best.

✈️ Travel Palace
For men: every time you travel, you attract women. Be careful what that leads to. For women: you cope by shopping. Especially when abroad, stressed, or emotionally overwhelmed. Your money might walk when your emotions crash — so watch your spending habits during down moments.
With Hua Ke: once you go out, you disappear for hours. You want to explore everything. With Hua Ji: travel can lead to emotional drama — especially with people. With strong supportive stars (Wen Chang, Wen Qu, Zuo Fu, You Bi): you won’t leave a mall until you’ve seen every shop.

🏡 Property Palace
You don’t just live in one place. You accumulate homes, land, or inheritance over time. This is a “landlord star.” You may end up owning more property than you expected.
If positioned well, this star gives real estate luck — especially with beautiful, peaceful homes.

⭐ Tan Lang (Charisma Star) Star of Desire & Pleasure
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Expressive, charming, men = stylish, women = seductive
Wealth
Earns through luxury, performance, beauty, branding
Career
Suited for entertainment, social, media, arts, metaphysics, religious based, cemetery, luxury branding
⭐ Tan Lang (Star of Desire & Pleasure) This is the performer. The seducer. The one who wants it all — and often gets it.
Tan Lang is bold. It doesn’t hide. It represents talent, temptation, indulgence, and expression. When this star is in your chart, life is never boring — but it does need control.

🏠 Life Palace
You were born with desires. Big ones. Tan Lang in the Life Palace means you’re expressive, charming, and emotionally rich.
If you’re male: you care about your looks. You dress well, you move with style.
If you’re female: you're magnetic, seductive, and love playing with makeup and presentation.
With Hua Lu: even more expressive. More stylish. More flirtatious. You glow — and you know it. With Hua Ji: watch out — desire turns into chaos. Especially in relationships or impulsive decisions.

💰 Wealth Palace
You don’t like saving. You like living. Your money goes into beauty, performance, or things that make life more exciting.
You’re best at earning through:
Luxury brands
Cosmetics, skincare, or fashion
Entertainment, music, speaking, teaching
Raw materials or product-based businesses with flair
You’re talented — but your money follows your emotions. When you’re lit up, you make more.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
This is the stage. You were made to be seen — or at least heard.
You do well in:
Media, content, entertainment
Coaching or training (especially with personality)
Sales, beauty, or luxury product industries
Religious or spiritual fields (yes, Tan Lang can also go into spiritual coaching)
But you must channel your desires into something bigger — or else you’ll burn out chasing trends.

🧒 Siblings Palace
Your siblings may be expressive, dramatic, or creative. Not always easy to manage — but definitely interesting.
If you’re the older one, you might end up being the “fun” sibling — the one who breaks the rules.

💍 Spouse Palace
Your love life is rich. You feel deeply. You fall hard. And you expect a lot.
You’re romantic, passionate, sometimes a little jealous. But you're also capable of deep loyalty if the other person matches your intensity.

👶 Children Palace
Your kids are likely full of emotion, creativity, and… wants. They’ll talk a lot, dream big, and ask for more.
With Hua Ji: may have issues with fertility — or a chance of not having children at all. If you do have kids, guide them early to manage desire and not seek shortcuts.

👫 Friends Palace
You’re social. You mix with many different types of people. Your friend circle is wide — but not always deep.
You seek fun, passion, excitement — and attract friends who bring color into your life. Just be mindful of fake support or people who feed your impulses.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
Your parents may have been indulgent — or focused on appearances. You may have learned from young that being “liked” = being safe.
This could push you to constantly prove yourself or stay in “performance mode” too long. Healing starts when you allow yourself to feel without needing an audience.

🏥 Health Palace
The main areas to watch:
Hormones
Endocrine system
Emotional-physical imbalance
With Hua Ji: be cautious — long-term emotional stress or unresolved trauma can lead to major health issues, including cancer. This is a placement that requires emotional processing.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You dream big. You believe in rewarding yourself. You need pleasure in life — whether that’s in food, beauty, experiences, or self-love.
But remember: when desire runs wild, you lose clarity. Pleasure is power only when managed.

✈️ Travel Palace
You don’t just go out — you go out to feel alive.
With Hua Lu: travel = freedom, beauty, enjoyment. You live your best life on vacation.
With Hua Ji: you lose control. Shopping nonstop, emotional spending, or chasing pleasure without boundaries.
Your wallet often empties after every trip — unless you plan ahead.

🏡 Property Palace
You don’t just want a home — you want a statement. Stylish condos, city views, fancy interiors. You love places that look good, feel luxurious, and reflect your taste.
Owning multiple homes? Very possible. Especially if you channel your desires into long-term planning instead of just short-term enjoyment.

⭐ Ju Men (Persuader Star) Star of Persuasion and Complexity
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Sharp-tongued, skeptical, private; strong speaker, but full of inner doubt
Wealth
Earns through speaking or hidden channels; underground money
Career
Best in law, politics, speaker, psychology, domestic cars or anything involving words
⭐ Ju Men (Star of Speech & Shadows) This is the star of secrets, sharp words, and suspicion.
Ju Men people speak well — sometimes too well. You have the power to persuade… but also the habit of questioning everything. Wherever this star sits, expect something hidden, something smart, and something sensitive.

🏠 Life Palace
You were born observant. You don’t talk for fun — you talk to understand, to protect, or to influence.
You may come off skeptical, guarded, or intense — but that’s because you’re always scanning for what’s not being said.
With Hua Lu: Your words heal. You’re persuasive, inspiring, able to uplift with your voice.
With Hua Ji: Your words hurt. You get pulled into gossip, drama, or negativity — even if you didn’t start it.
Many Ju Men people struggle with inner doubt. Paranoia, overthinking, or always questioning others’ intentions. But once you find clarity — you become a master communicator.

💰 Wealth Palace
You make money using your mouth. Speaking, teaching, negotiating, selling, broadcasting, advising — anything that involves language.
You’re also capable of earning hidden wealth:
Undisclosed commissions
Silent partnerships
Underground income streams
Side hustles nobody knows about
This is not a public-facing money style — it's discreet, strategic, and often untraceable.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
You belong in roles that require smart words and sharp thinking:
Lawyer
Politician
Therapist
Content creator
Strategist
Brand or PR roles
You perform best behind the scenes — crafting the message, shaping the influence. You’re not always the face, but you’re always the brain behind the curtain.

🧒 Siblings Palace
You might not be close to your siblings. Even if you are, there's emotional distance or unspoken competition.
You may grow up feeling like you're not fully seen — or like you always have to guard something, even at home.

💍 Spouse Palace
You’re the kind of person who doesn’t like announcing your love life. You might:
Avoid posting your partner
Not tell people where you're going
Keep your emotions protected — even in long-term relationships
There’s often a “shadow” to your relationships. It doesn’t mean cheating — it just means you don’t like being exposed.

👶 Children Palace
You’re likely to have sons first. Your kids may be:
Verbally expressive
Emotionally sensitive
Or difficult to read, with many layers
You’ll need to learn how to guide without interrogating. Let them open up in their own time.

👫 Friends Palace
You don’t show your whole social life to the world. You might:
Keep multiple friend groups
Not post much about hangouts
Avoid being too “seen” in social settings
People might not even know who your closest friends are — and you like it that way.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
This often indicates an emotionally reserved relationship with one or both parents — usually the father.
You may grow up feeling like:
There are things not said
Your parent held secrets
Or you couldn’t fully understand their emotions
It doesn’t mean it’s a bad relationship — just one with hidden layers.

🏥 Health Palace
Ju Men rules:
Mouth
Stomach
Internal organs
Any disease that’s hard to detect
With Hua Ji: high risk of serious or chronic illness — especially conditions like cancer that go unnoticed until later. Listen to your body. When something feels wrong — don’t delay.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You think a lot. Too much, sometimes. Suspicion, doubt, emotional spirals — these come easily.
To feel peace, you need clarity. Not perfection — just clear truths. Journaling, structured routines, and safe environments help you feel mentally clean.

✈️ Travel Palace
You don’t like being tracked. You travel on your own terms. You may:
Go off-grid
Avoid telling people where you’re going
Or enjoy secret retreats and solo adventures
Ju Men energy during travel is private pleasure — not group fun.

🏡 Property Palace
You’re sensitive to your environment. You prefer homes that are:
Quiet
Spacious
Dim or softly lit
Near temples, cemeteries, or spiritual spaces
With Hua Lu: homes with water nearby — rivers, pools, lakes — feel good for you. With Hua Ji: be cautious. You may live in places prone to flooding, arguments, or energetic imbalance (messy, noisy, or emotionally tense environments).
You don’t want a loud, busy home. You want peace — even if it’s a little eerie.

Underground income streams
Side hustles nobody knows about
This is not a public-facing money style — it's discreet, strategic, and often untraceable.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
You belong in roles that require smart words and sharp thinking:
Lawyer
Politician
Therapist
Content creator
Strategist
Brand or PR roles
You perform best behind the scenes — crafting the message, shaping the influence. You’re not always the face, but you’re always the brain behind the curtain.

🧒 Siblings Palace
You might not be close to your siblings. Even if you are, there's emotional distance or unspoken competition.
You may grow up feeling like you're not fully seen — or like you always have to guard something, even at home.

💍 Spouse Palace
You’re the kind of person who doesn’t like announcing your love life. You might:
Avoid posting your partner
Not tell people where you're going
Keep your emotions protected — even in long-term relationships
There’s often a “shadow” to your relationships. It doesn’t mean cheating — it just means you don’t like being exposed.

👶 Children Palace
You’re likely to have sons first. Your kids may be:
Verbally expressive
Emotionally sensitive
Or difficult to read, with many layers
You’ll need to learn how to guide without interrogating. Let them open up in their own time.

👫 Friends Palace
You don’t show your whole social life to the world. You might:
Keep multiple friend groups
Not post much about hangouts
Avoid being too “seen” in social settings
People might not even know who your closest friends are — and you like it that way.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
This often indicates an emotionally reserved relationship with one or both parents — usually the father.
You may grow up feeling like:
There are things not said
Your parent held secrets
Or you couldn’t fully understand their emotions
It doesn’t mean it’s a bad relationship — just one with hidden layers.

🏥 Health Palace
Ju Men rules:
Mouth
Stomach
Internal organs
Any disease that’s hard to detect
With Hua Ji: high risk of serious or chronic illness — especially conditions like cancer that go unnoticed until later. Listen to your body. When something feels wrong — don’t delay.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You think a lot. Too much, sometimes. Suspicion, doubt, emotional spirals — these come easily.
To feel peace, you need clarity. Not perfection — just clear truths. Journaling, structured routines, and safe environments help you feel mentally clean.

✈️ Travel Palace
You don’t like being tracked. You travel on your own terms. You may:
Go off-grid
Avoid telling people where you’re going
Or enjoy secret retreats and solo adventures
Ju Men energy during travel is private pleasure — not group fun.

🏡 Property Palace
You’re sensitive to your environment. You prefer homes that are:
Quiet
Spacious
Dim or softly lit
Near temples, cemeteries, or spiritual spaces
With Hua Lu: homes with water nearby — rivers, pools, lakes — feel good for you. With Hua Ji: be cautious. You may live in places prone to flooding, arguments, or energetic imbalance (messy, noisy, or emotionally tense environments).
You don’t want a loud, busy home. You want peace — even if it’s a little eerie.

⭐ Tai Yang (Leader Star) Star of Radiance & Generosity
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Confident, generous, proud; symbolizes men and status
Wealth
Earns through business, hot markets, visible roles
Career
Suited for big corporations, law, politics, luxury, energy sectors
⭐ Tai Yang (Star of Radiance & Generosity) This is the sun. The star of visibility, pride, and public energy.
Where Tai Yang shines, things grow. But when it’s blocked — everything dims.
Tai Yang represents men, fame, confidence, and generosity. It’s bold, it’s big-hearted, and it wants to be seen.

🏠 Life Palace
You were born to stand out. You walk with presence. People look. People remember. You’re generous, ambitious, and sometimes — yes — prideful.
Hua Lu: You’re giving. Open-handed. People feel your warmth.
Hua Quan: You’re confident, proud, and maybe a little obsessed with your image.
Hua Ji: You have light… but it’s blocked. It’s like the sun behind a cloud — bright inside, but people can’t see it. This creates frustration: “Why don’t they notice me?”
You may struggle with visibility wounds — moments where you shine inside but feel invisible outside. The key? Stop proving, start embodying.

💰 Wealth Palace
Your money comes from the spotlight.
Businesses
Market-facing roles
Sales, branding, trading
Anything “hot” or fast-moving
You do best when you’re seen — as a leader, as a face, as a name people know.
But with Hua Ji here? Be careful. You may fail in mainstream industries — especially those with too much competition or regulation. Instead, look into niche, hidden, or less conventional money paths.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
Tai Yang here pushes you into big systems and bold industries.
You’re built for:
Law
Politics
Luxury branding
Corporate leadership
Energy, automotive, or public service sectors
Any field that requires confidence, presence, and high stakes
You're not meant for quiet cubicles. You thrive when you're out there, shaking hands, making waves, owning rooms.

🧒 Siblings Palace
You naturally take on the leadership role among siblings. Whether you’re eldest or not — you’re the one expected to provide, guide, or represent the family pride.
This can create pressure. But also, a deep sense of mission.

💍 Spouse Palace
For women: you attract a lot of attention in love. Or your partner does. For men: your spouse may be charming, admired — or even have a lot of hidden suitors.
In either case, this placement brings high visibility in relationships — which isn’t always easy. There’s often tension between wanting privacy… and being watched.

👶 Children Palace
You’re likely to have sons — or children who act bold, expressive, and high-energy. They may seek attention early and have strong opinions.
Raising them requires strength — not control, but leadership.

👫 Friends Palace
You attract high-energy friends. They like movement, recognition, achievement. This is not the quiet, chill circle — it’s the motivated, visible, let’s-go-get-it group.
Be careful of comparison. Some may compete more than support.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
The father figure plays a major role. This could be:
A powerful dad
A dad you look up to
Or a father who left a mark — whether through presence or absence
Your upbringing likely valued achievement, respect, and carrying the family name with pride.

🏥 Health Palace
Tai Yang rules:
Heart
Head
Eyes
You may experience:
Migraines
High blood pressure
Eye strain
Or stress-related heart issues
You push hard — and sometimes don’t slow down until your body forces you to.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
For women: this placement often means your emotional world is tied to men. You might:
Care deeply what men think
Feel validated by male attention
Or constantly attract situations that test your worth in love
The key: step into your own light — not just reflect his.
For all genders: your peace comes when you stop performing and start believing your value is already there.

✈️ Travel Palace
You shine brighter outside your comfort zone. Many Tai Yang placements feel more alive, more respected, and more powerful when traveling or moving away from hometown.
Travel activates your light. Whether it’s for work, events, or just clarity — being seen in new places brings power.

🏡 Property Palace
You like homes that feel open, bright, elevated. Places with sunlight, status, and clean energy.
You may inherit property from your father — or live in homes that reflect your masculine side: modern, strong, statement-driven.
With Hua Lu: you live near water — a pool, river, or open space with brightness. With Hua Ji: your home may have issues — water damage, tension, arguments, or energy that feels heavy. This isn’t about size. It’s about whether the space supports your light.

⭐ Qi Sha (Enforcer Star) Star of Battle & Speed
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Strong personality; sharp, bold, empathy
Wealth
High-risk, high-reward mindset
Career
Suits sales, fighting industries, fast-paced roles
⭐ Qi Sha (Star of Battle & Breakthrough) This is the fighter. The initiator. The one who moves before asking.
Qi Sha doesn’t wait. It attacks. Wherever this star sits, you’ll find courage, urgency, and pressure.
It’s not a peaceful star. But it’s a damn powerful one — especially when tamed.

🏠 Life Palace
Your personality is strong. You don’t back down. You speak up. You do what others hesitate to do.
This doesn’t mean you’re rude — but you’re not soft. People feel your energy from the moment you enter the room.
You hate slow movers, fake people, and indecision. But the challenge is: learning to lead without needing to fight.

💰 Wealth Palace
You earn fast — or you lose fast. There’s no in-between.
Qi Sha doesn’t save quietly. You make bold investments, try high-risk moves, and sometimes… go all-in when you’re not fully ready.
To win in wealth:
Set up systems
Use your speed, but build structure
Don’t trust everyone — your impulsiveness can attract scammers or poor decisions

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
Perfect for:
Sales
Startup hustle
Competitive roles
Military, law enforcement, fitness, or construction
Any “fight to win” profession
You perform best under pressure. The more adrenaline, the more alive you feel. But burnout is real — remember to pause before your body forces you to.

🧒 Siblings Palace
Your siblings are like you — sharp, direct, and sometimes too similar. This creates friction in childhood, especially with power struggles.
But as adults, the bond becomes strong — once everyone respects each other’s strength.

💍 Spouse Palace
You fall fast — and sometimes marry fast. Qi Sha brings “instant fire” energy to love. Strong chemistry, quick decisions, intense connection.
But it also means: your partner is no pushover. They’re bold, maybe even stubborn — just like you.
It’s either power couple… or power struggle. Learn to soften. That’s your key to long-term success in love.

👶 Children Palace
Your kids are energetic, bold, and probably don’t listen. They’re risk-takers. Always testing limits.
As a parent, you’ll need to discipline with firmness and heart. They’ll respect strength, not softness.

👫 Friends Palace
You’re fast to connect. Social, quick, unfiltered. You don’t need 10 meetups — just one strong vibe, and it’s a friendship.
But your energy can attract intensity — strong friends, but also dramatic ones. Choose your circle wisely.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
Your upbringing was not gentle. Either your parents were strict, or the dynamic felt like a constant test.
You may grow up feeling like you need to prove something all the time.
But the real breakthrough comes when you stop fighting to be loved — and simply allow yourself to be seen.

🏥 Health Palace
Qi Sha rules injuries and “hard” parts of the body:
Gut
Bones
Cuts, breaks, bleeding
You recover fast — but you also get hurt fast, especially through accidents or intense sports.
Your health tip: don’t wait until the pain is unbearable. Catch it early.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
Your thoughts move at lightning speed. You get excited… then you act. But sometimes, that means you regret what you didn’t slow down to feel.
Meditation, journaling, or solo time helps — even though you resist it.
Peace doesn’t come from silence. It comes from clear direction.

✈️ Travel Palace
You don’t plan much. You wake up, book a ticket, and go. Spontaneous travel is your style — and you love moving fast.
But sometimes your plans crash last minute, or change halfway. So always keep buffer time, backup plans, and flexibility.

🏡 Property Palace
You buy on impulse. One minute you’re “just viewing,” next minute you’ve paid the deposit.
Be careful: Qi Sha here means you might:
Buy for the wrong reasons
Regret location
Rush renovations or flip homes too fast
You need grounding before property decisions. Bring someone calm to check your blind spots.

Your thoughts move at lightning speed. You get excited… then you act. But sometimes, that means you regret what you didn’t slow down to feel.
Meditation, journaling, or solo time helps — even though you resist it.
Peace doesn’t come from silence. It comes from clear direction.

✈️ Travel Palace
You don’t plan much. You wake up, book a ticket, and go. Spontaneous travel is your style — and you love moving fast.
But sometimes your plans crash last minute, or change halfway. So always keep buffer time, backup plans, and flexibility.

🏡 Property Palace
You buy on impulse. One minute you’re “just viewing,” next minute you’ve paid the deposit.
Be careful: Qi Sha here means you might:
Buy for the wrong reasons
Regret location
Rush renovations or flip homes too fast
You need grounding before property decisions. Bring someone calm to check your blind spots.

⭐ Po Jun (Disruptor Star) Star of Destruction & Breakthrough
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Direct, rebellious, stubborn; confronts people openly
Wealth
Succeed after few tries; needs multiple failures to win
Career
Suitable in renovation, shipping, logistics, warehouse, grocery store, wet market, seafood, truck
⭐ Po Jun (Star of Destruction & Breakthrough) This is the wrecking ball star. It doesn’t follow — it breaks, then rebuilds.
Po Jun is intense. Aggressive. Forward. But not in a subtle way — in a “you’ll know when I enter the room” way.
This star doesn’t walk away. It argues. It challenges. And it only learns after crashing.

🏠 Life Palace
You are not here to please anyone. You speak directly. You confront things head-on. You challenge ideas publicly. People either respect you… or avoid you.
You’re stubborn. Sharp. You don’t play games.
But underneath that fire is someone who grows the hard way — through destruction. You’re “break first, fix later.” And that’s not a weakness — it’s how you reinvent.
People might call you “difficult.” But often, it’s because you say what they don’t dare say.

💰 Wealth Palace
Forget getting it right the first time. Po Jun here = your first business, investment, or money idea probably fails. Not because you’re dumb — but because you need chaos before clarity.
You're best at:
Starting again
Pioneering new ideas
Breaking systems and creating your own
Solving problems others ignore
If someone tries to pull you into a “perfect” first-time opportunity — walk away. Your wealth comes through battle-tested wins.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
This is the “clean up the mess” star. You do well in industries that involve:
Breaking, fixing, or reshaping
Warehousing, trucking, renovation, logistics
Shipping, fishing, heavy-duty trades
Unpolished, raw, physical work
You’re not built for desk jobs. You’re built for chaos — and for turning chaos into systems.

🧒 Siblings Palace
Childhood relationships with siblings may have been rough. You might have felt ignored, judged, or disconnected growing up.
But as you age, things improve. You start seeing each other clearly. And sometimes, those childhood enemies become adult allies.

💍 Spouse Palace
Your love life takes time to settle. First relationship? Usually doesn’t last. You need to break, learn, heal — then choose wisely.
You’re intense in love. You don’t fake your feelings. But you may attract dramatic or short-lived relationships until you understand your patterns.

👶 Children Palace
Very high fertility energy. You or your partner may conceive easily — even when not planned.
Usually daughters come first. And it’s possible to have multiple children.
Be mindful of parenting with pressure — your strong energy may dominate unless you learn to guide with softness.

👫 Friends Palace
You have strange friendship timing. People you meet 10 years ago… may only become close 20 years later.
You may know many, but feel close to few. And when you reconnect with someone from the past — it’s often powerful.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
Childhood = misunderstanding. You might have felt rejected, controlled, or simply out of sync with your parents (especially one of them).
But once you grow up, or get married — the bond heals. Sometimes they move in. Sometimes you start taking care of them. But the warmth comes later, not early.

🏥 Health Palace
Po Jun rules strange, often inherited conditions:
Rare skin issues
Discharges
Unusual genetic symptoms (like missing ligaments, joint problems)
For men: hemorrhoids, sexual health problems
Most aren’t fatal — but they’re weird. Doctors may not catch them early. Modern medicine can help — but only if you check regularly.
With strong Po Jun: your body breaks first… then gets rebuilt stronger.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You don’t forget what people did. You might not argue on the spot… but you store it.
You judge silently, replaying situations in your mind. You don't like being told what to do — and you don’t trust easily.
Emotional peace only comes when you release the scorecard. You're powerful, but holding on to every wrong moment drains your inner power.

✈️ Travel Palace
You're unpredictable. You say you're going to A… but end up in B. You change plans constantly. You shift routes on the fly.
Even when you go on trips — it’s rarely smooth. Your car might detour. Plans get reshuffled. Emotions change. But in the end — your kind of travel always brings new strategy.
You're a recon person — testing the terrain before others go.

🏡 Property Palace
You don’t like what’s given. If your parents gift you a house — you might sell it, renovate it, or reject it entirely.
You need freedom in how you live.
You’re also prone to moving multiple times, or living in unpolished spaces and slowly transforming them.
You don’t need fancy. You need function and freedom — your space, your way.

⭐ Tian Tong (Peacemaker Star) Star of Innocence & Ease
Palace
Key Meaning
Life
Childlike vibe; emotional, gentle, or a little too relaxed.
Wealth
Not proactive with money; needs vision to move
Career
Enjoys light, comfortable roles - f&b, kindergarten, freelance, shopping, renovation, decoration, gov jobs 
⭐ Tian Tong (Star of Innocence & Ease) This is the baby of the system — soft, emotional, playful, and sometimes… lazy.
Tian Tong doesn’t fight. It flows. Wherever it appears in your chart, it brings a childlike softness, a love for comfort, and a slightly “blur” kind of charm.
But don’t let that fool you. Tian Tong people aren’t weak — they’re just wired for peace.

🏠 Life Palace
You carry a childlike presence. People may find you cute, gentle, or a little too relaxed. You feel young — even if your age says otherwise.
With Hua Lu: You go with the flow. Chill, relaxed, sometimes too cincai.
With Hua Quan: You're stable, emotionally grounded, and wise for your age — like a young person with old-soul energy.
With Hua Ji: You become extremely lazy, passive, avoidant. This is where “forever student” syndrome shows up. Suggestion? Get a stable job — public sector or anything with structure helps anchor you.
You may also be physically soft — Hua Lu = more round, Hua Ji = more skinny or low appetite.

💰 Wealth Palace
You're not naturally aggressive when it comes to making money. You won’t chase it — it has to be meaningful or structured for you to bother.
Without a goal? You coast. But once you set a target — your energy activates fast.
Your biggest risk = avoiding financial responsibility until it becomes a problem. Set clear financial goals, and build systems to keep you accountable.

🧑‍💼 Career Palace
You’re not built for high-pressure roles. You function best in environments that are:
Supportive
Gentle-paced
Emotionally balanced
You’d do well in:
Childcare
Hospitality
Healing arts
Admin or stable government work
You need structure — or you’ll float forever.

🧒 Siblings Palace
You likely have a good emotional connection with your siblings. It’s not competitive — it’s caring. Even if there are arguments, they don’t usually last.
You’re either the peacekeeper in the family or the one everyone tries to protect.

💍 Spouse Palace
Your partner may be someone who’s gentle, emotionally present… and maybe a little chubby. This placement brings comfort-oriented partners — people who love to nest, eat, cuddle, and just be.
The downside? Both of you may avoid facing tough conversations unless forced to. Work on communication early.

👶 Children Palace
Children here are expressive, emotionally deep, and often imaginative. You might have more girls — or kids who act more “soft” regardless of gender.
Your parenting challenge = managing their emotional ups and downs while managing your own.

👫 Friends Palace
Your friend circle often includes younger people or those with a playful, relaxed energy.
But if you have Hua Ji here — warning: Your friends might not really be “friends.” You attract flaky people, or “surface-level fun” types. They’re there when it’s convenient — but disappear when things get serious.
Choose wisely. You don’t need many — you need real.

👨‍👩‍👦 Parents Palace
Your childhood may have felt very protected. Either your parents gave you too much emotional cushioning — or they avoided conflict and taught you to do the same.
You might grow up struggling to handle pressure or direct confrontation. Learning to self-regulate becomes crucial.

🏥 Health Palace
Tian Tong governs emotional health. You’re prone to:
Stress-related fatigue
Digestive issues linked to anxiety
Energy crashes after emotional overwhelm
You don’t get sick often — but when you do, it often ties to how you’re feeling, not what you ate.

🧘 Wellbeing Palace
You love life. You enjoy good food, a cozy home, warm connections.
But your emotional state fluctuates — you go from joy to sadness quickly.
Tian Tong here gives a big heart… but also a fragile one. Practice emotional anchoring and avoid numbing through comfort.

✈️ Travel Palace
This is one of the best placements for Tian Tong. You come alive when you travel — especially when the trip feels relaxed, joyful, childlike.
But if you have Hua Ji here — watch out: You may develop a “princess syndrome.” Avoiding the sun, hating discomfort, always needing someone to go with you. You might become that person who cancels plans just because there’s no shade.
You learn the most when you leave your comfort zone.

🏡 Property Palace
You like homes that feel like resorts. Jacuzzi, reading corner, coffee machine, water features — yes, please.
You care less about square footage, more about vibe. If your house doesn’t feel soft, safe, and luxurious in small ways — you won’t enjoy living there.

This is one of the best placements for Tian Tong. You come alive when you travel — especially when the trip feels relaxed, joyful, childlike.
But if you have Hua Ji here — watch out: You may develop a “princess syndrome.” Avoiding the sun, hating discomfort, always needing someone to go with you. You might become that person who cancels plans just because there’s no shade.
You learn the most when you leave your comfort zone.

🏡 Property Palace
You like homes that feel like resorts. Jacuzzi, reading corner, coffee machine, water features — yes, please.
You care less about square footage, more about vibe. If your house doesn’t feel soft, safe, and luxurious in small ways — you won’t enjoy living there.

South + South = Thoughtful but stuck
I know what I want, but I don’t move
🗣️ Script:
Have you ever had moments like this — where the plan is already set, the vision is clear, you know what you should do… but somehow… you never moved?
Not because you’re lazy. Not because you don’t care. In fact, you care deeply.
But it’s like something inside keeps pulling the brakes. You second guess. You overthink. You prepare, and prepare again. But when it’s time to act — you stall.
That’s South + South energy. Gentle. Stable. Wise. But if not balanced — it becomes stuck. You live a thoughtful life… but not a moved life.
You don’t want to settle for less — but if your chart lacks activation, you end up missing the window of destiny.
Sometimes, it’s not that your dreams are too far. It’s just your fire is too quiet.


215

🗣️ Script:
Now let me flip the script. You’re not stuck. You’re doing everything. You’re trying. You’re building. You’re hustling like crazy — and yet… something’s still missing.
You’ve changed jobs, changed cities, changed partners — but the question still lingers: “Is this it?”
You thought being productive means being fulfilled. But somewhere along the way, you stopped hearing your own voice.
That’s North + North energy. Powerful. Fast. Ambitious. But if not grounded — it becomes restless.
And here’s the hardest part to admit: The world may clap for your success, but you… you feel disconnected from yourself.
You’ve been so busy chasing achievement — you forgot how to enjoy presence. You forgot the warmth of your children’s laughter, the peace of a quiet morning, the way your home feels when you slow down.
This is what happens when Yang energy burns too long without Yin.


216

North + North = Driven but Disconnected
I do so much, but I feel lost inside.
🗣️ Script:
Now let me flip the script. You’re not stuck. You’re doing everything. You’re trying. You’re building. You’re hustling like crazy — and yet… something’s still missing.
You’ve changed jobs, changed cities, changed partners — but the question still lingers: “Is this it?”
You thought being productive means being fulfilled. But somewhere along the way, you stopped hearing your own voice.

This is what happens when Yang energy burns too long without Yin.


217

Balance of north + south stars = True Strength
The North Stars (Bei Dou) represent strength and action; The South Stars (Nan Dou) represent softness and strategy.
If a person’s Life Palace and Body Palace are both filled with North Stars, their personality may become overly aggressive — best suited to charge ahead, like a warrior or general. If both are South Stars, they may be too soft — more suited as behind-the-scenes planners or advisors.
The ideal setup? A balance between North and South Stars — North in Life, South in Body, or vice versa. That creates someone who is both strong and adaptable — able to lead in battle, but also plan for peace.
The same applies to leadership and team building:
A great leader must embody both strength and flexibility, to expand when needed, and stabilize when required — that’s how you build and sustain a thriving organization.
Team members with strong North Star energy (more aggressive) should be placed in roles that break new ground or lead expansion.
Those with strong South Star energy (gentler) are better placed in support, maintenance, or admin functions.
When you understand this dynamic of North-South polarity, you’ll know how to read people and place them well — so your team can move like water: flexible outside, firm within. That’s what true strength looks like.


218

How To Identify?
Personality & Behavior:
- Look at 1 + 11 palace 

Wealth & Career Strength:
- Look at 1 + 5 + 9 palace

Then, calculate the ratio of northern vs southern stars → easily to categorize.
“Now you might ask — how do you actually see this in your chart?
It’s simple. Different parts of the chart show different sides of you:
If you want to see personality and behavior, look at the Life Palace together with the Wellbeing Palace.
If you want to see wealth and career strength, look at the trio of palaces: 1, 5, and 9.
This way, you’re not just guessing based on how you ‘feel’ — you’re reading directly from the structure of your stars.”

When one person changes,  
the whole home shifts.

What you’ve learned so far — it’s powerful. Once one person’s energy rises, it naturally pulls the whole environment with it.
But sometimes, when you start improving — your energy grows faster than the people around you. You’re ready to move forward… but your spouse hesitates. Your parents worry. Your team or kids feel off.
It’s not because they don’t support you. It’s because their timing, their energy cycle — is different.
And that’s why even good people, in the same house, can accidentally block each other’s flow.


Your destiny doesn’t live alone. It’s connected to your family’s flow.
Zi Wei Dou Shu isn’t meant to stop at just your chart — it was created so you can understand the entire system around you.
Because the truth is, if only you’re improving but your family’s timing is out of sync, sooner or later you’ll feel pulled back.
Real stability happens when everyone — your partner, your children, your parents — moves in the same direction.
When that alignment happens, you’ll notice your home energy becomes lighter, decision-making gets easier, and opportunities multiply naturally.
That’s why this next part is so important — to align not just you, but the people who share your life and energy every day.


Some of you texted our team asking:
“Can I consult for my whole family?”

Now i just wanna spend a quick 3 minute to talk about this, because some of you already asked our team this week — “Can I do a consultation for my whole family too?”
So this part is for you.
I’m not here to teach extra advanced techniques. Everything you need to decode your own chart is already inside this 3-day workshop.
This is simply an extra layer — for those who not only want to improve themselves… but also want to help their loved ones rise faster, avoid mistakes, and move in the right timing together.
You’ve already invested time understanding your chart. Now, let me help you shortcut that same clarity for the people who matter most to you.


The Family Destiny Alignment(Existing Students Exclusive)
(Align your household’s energy before 2026 begins)
This Family Destiny Alignment is a private 1-on-1 session where I personally look at your family’s charts — Whether is your spouse, your children, or even your parents.
And I can tell you this — for most people, the biggest energy leak doesn’t come from business / career or money. It comes from home.
When you’re growing fast but your partner doesn’t understand your direction…
Some of you are already growing fast, learning, improving — but the moment you step back into your house, it feels like nobody understands you.
You’re the one who keeps trying. You’re the one who plans, who takes care, who works hard to make things better. But sometimes, no matter how much you give… it still feels like you’re the only one putting in effort.
And the truth is — it’s not because they don’t love you, it’s not because anyone’s wrong. it’s because all of you are operating in different timing, different season, different energy cycles.
One person’s in a “go” season, another’s in “slow.”Maybe you wants to change, but your spouse just wants peace. So of course, you clash.
In this session, we’ll decode how each person’s chart interacts with yours — who’s in their growth phase, who needs more support, and how to rebuild that connection without losing yourself.
When you finally understand that rhythm, everything shifts.You’ll notice something simple but powerful —fewer arguments, more peace, more support.
 Suddenly, your spouse gets you — they start to see your effort, not take it for granted. Your kids stop resisting so much & start listening to you, because you’re guiding them the way their chart understands. Even your parents starting to trust your direction
And that’s the beauty of alignment — it’s not about learning more Zi Wei Dou Shu, it’s about using what you’ve already learned to bring peace and support back into your home.



When families align, everything multiplies.
I’ve seen this so many times — after students did the family package, not only they got clearer about themselves, but the whole family energy shifted.
One parent realised her son wasn’t “naughty” or “not focused” — his chart had a highly creative star. Once she stopped forcing him to study the same way as others, he started doing his homework by himself, and within a few months, his results went from average to A’s.
Another parent found out her daughter’s constant talking back wasn’t bad attitude — her chart showed strong independence energy. After she changed the way she talked to her, they became much closer — even started going out for lunch together again.
And for couples — this one really melts my heart. One wife told me she used to think her husband didn’t care anymore — always busy, always quiet. But after seeing his chart, she realised he’s in a responsibility-heavy cycle, carrying too much pressure silently.
After that, she stopped arguing and started showing small support — simple things like talking softly when he’s tired, or planning weekends around his rest time. Within weeks, their communication totally changed — he started opening up again, even took her out for dinner, something they hadn’t done in years.
When you truly understand your family’s chart, love becomes easier. Because you stop guessing — you know how to love them right. You stop fighting people you’re supposed to build with. You save time, save emotion — and your home finally moves forward together.

Day-2 Homework
Your Winning Strategy Map
One action to take today, one trap to avoid this year.
Alright, let’s talk about your Day 2 homework — who’s excited about today? Type 1 in the chat

so this is called Your Winning Strategy Map. Today, you’re going to lock in one action you’ll take immediately, and one trap you’ll avoid for the rest of this year. This is how we turn everything you learned today into something you can actually use.

Today’s challenge is about turning your chart insights into ACTION.

You’ve seen your Green Light (Lu Activation) : what to DO.

 You’ve seen your Red Light (Ji Activation) : what to AVOID.

Now we’re going to lock in Your Winning Strategy Map so you start implementing what you learn.
Today’s homework is simple — it’s about turning your chart insights into action. You’ve already seen your Green Light, or Lu Activation — this tells you exactly what to do. You’ve also seen your Red Light, or Ji Activation — this tells you exactly what to avoid. Now we’re going to put them together into your personal Winning Strategy Map, so you leave here knowing exactly what to do — and what to avoid

Claim Your Worksheet & Template
This is what your worksheet looks like — and I’ve also put the QR code here so you can open and fill it in. It’s the exact same structure you saw earlier: your Lu Activation on the left, your Ji Activation on the right. This makes your ‘do this’ and ‘don’t do this’ crystal clear at a glance.

Choose ONE small but powerful step you can take before the day ends to move toward your Green Light action.
Keep it:
Tangible: Something you can complete today
Wealth-linked: Moves you closer to your goal
Simple: No overthinking, just do it
Once you’ve identified your Green Light, I want you to choose one small but powerful step you can take before the day ends to move toward it. Keep it tangible — something you can actually complete today. Keep it wealth-linked — it must move you closer to your goal. And keep it simple — no overthinking, just do it."

Claim Your Worksheet & Template
Here’s a sample of how it could look once it’s filled in. On the Lu side, Career – Tian Ji, Wu Qu, representing strategic projects and launching new offers. Timing is active in both the 10-Year and this year. The action is to publish five short videos per week for the next 12 months. Following this could mean gaining a thousand followers and ten qualified leads this month. On the Ji side, Wealth – Lian Zhen, representing risky investments, active this year. The trap to avoid is putting money into unknown ventures, because ignoring it could cost a hundred thousand dollars and stop me from expanding my business. And for today’s step — reach out to three potential collaborators to explore new project opportunities.

Complete your Winning Strategy Map before the day ends.
Tomorrow we’ll build on it.
Opportunities don’t wait… neither should you.
So, before today ends, complete your Winning Strategy Map. Because tomorrow… we’re taking it up a level.
We’re going to connect & implement everything you’ve learned — your goals from Day 1, your strategy from Day 2 — and turn it into the momentum that carries you through the rest of this year.
And here’s the truth: the people who get the biggest breakthroughs tomorrow… are the ones who come in already taking action today.
Once you’ve completed your Winning Strategy Map, send it to us. I might even pull up a few examples tomorrow — and who knows, yours could inspire the whole room. Plus, it’s the fastest way to make sure you’re on the right track before we step into Day 3.
Opportunities don’t wait. Champions don’t wait. So finish it, send it in, and let’s make it happen.


Day 1 - CLARITY
Day 2 - STRATEGY
Stop Reading. Start Designing.
Before we wrap up, I want to say something important.
And this is especially for those of you who might be feeling overwhelmed right now.
Yes — I know Zi Wei Dou Shu can look very technical.
Palaces, stars, four transformations, flying here, flying there…
If it’s your first time, of course you feel blur.
But let me give you a better way.
Don’t let the system control you.
Use the system to serve your goal.
Zi Wei is not about memorizing star meanings.
Zi Wei is a tool.
And tools only work… when you know what you want to build.
Just like ChatGPT.
Have you heard of tool is dead?
Tool is dead. But when you know how to ask the right questions,
you gain speed, clarity, and execution.
So don’t start by asking:
“What does this star mean here?”
“What does that combination mean there?”
You will drown.
Instead, ask:
What do I want?
What’s my next move in life?
Then…
Find the palace related to that goal.
Check the stars.
Decode only what matters.
That’s how you reverse engineer your destiny.
That’s how you stop wasting time.
That’s how you stop reading your chart like a textbook —
and start using it like a compass, like a real GPS.
Don’t force yourself to “fit the chart.”
Make the chart fit you.
So if you’re stuck — it’s not because Zi Wei is too deep.
It’s because you’re starting from the wrong end.
Flip it.
Start with your goals.
And let the chart show you the path.
That’s how you take back ownership.
That’s how you finally gain control of your direction — instead of letting others decide for you.

Day-2 Homework
Your Winning Strategy Map
One action to take today, one trap to avoid this year.
Alright, let’s talk about your Day 2 homework — who’s excited about today? Type 1 in the chat

so this is called Your Winning Strategy Map. 

Day 2’s challenge is about turning your chart insights into ACTION.

You’ve seen your Green Light (Lu Activation) : what to DO.

 You’ve seen your Red Light (Ji Activation) : what to AVOID.
YESTERDSAY homework

REAL ACTION TAKERS
First, I want to give a big round of applause to all of you who submitted your Day 2 homework. 👏 You didn’t just listen — you took action, you applied what you learned, and you made it real for yourself.
From what I’ve seen, many of you have done a great job connecting your Green Light (Lu Activation) to specific, measurable actions — things like ‘Secure 3 new clients by October,’ ‘Post 5 videos a week for 3 months,’ or ‘Shortlist 3 properties by year-end.’ When your action has a number and a date, it becomes real — it’s no longer just a nice idea.
Some of you, though, still kept it a bit vague — like “get more clients” or “be healthier.” That’s a good start, but remember, if you can’t measure it, it’s hard to track progress. So think: How many? By when? What’s the exact outcome I can see?
For the Red Light (Ji Activation), I’m really happy to see most of you not only know what to avoid, but also link it to specific risks — and some of you even quantified the cost. Things like ‘Lose RM20k in 3 months,’ or ‘Miss out on RM100k annual income’ — when you know the exact number, you’ll think twice before stepping into that trap.
But there are also a few who kept the ‘If I ignore’ part too general — like “I’ll miss opportunities” or “It will be bad.” Make it clear for yourself: How much will it cost you? How long will it set you back? That’s when your chart becomes a real-life decision tool.
So, well done to all the action takers — you’ve already moved further than most people who just ‘learn and forget.’ Now keep that momentum going, keep your focus sharp on your green light, and stay out of the red-light traps.”

RECAP FROM DAY 2

🧠 THE STRATEGY PLANNER
For those who build long-term wealth through systems, foresight, and structured power.


“Alright, let’s start with the first wealth code of the day — and this one is for the thinkers, the planners, the system builders.
These are the people who don’t randomly chase money. They want to know: 👉 What’s the structure? 👉 What’s the logic? 👉 What’s the long-term game?
They build their wealth through strategy and control. They’re not here for quick hacks. They’re here to build something that lasts — a system, a plan, or a team that works even when they’re not there.
If you’re someone who always needs a plan before you move — or you get frustrated when things are messy, uncertain, or inefficient — this might be your wealth code.”



🧠 🗂️ 📊 📆 SYSTEMS, STRUCTURE, PLANNING, FRAMEWORKS
“So who falls under the Strategy Planner wealth code?
👉 Stars like ziwei, tian liang, lianzhen, tianji 
These stars are naturally strong in logic, structure, and seeing the big picture. They can take chaos and turn it into clarity. They’re the backbone of systems, frameworks, and long-term planning.”



💰 THE INVESTMENT BRAIN
“YOU DON’T DO THE WORK, YOU MAKE MONEY DO THE WORK FOR YOU.”


“Now, let’s move into the second wealth code — the Investment Brain.
These stars don’t like guessing. They want to see the numbers before they make a move.
They grow their wealth through assets, savings, careful decisions, and consistent action. They may move slower than others — but every step they take is measured, steady, and intentional.
If you’re someone who prefers security over hype, and you like to know the numbers before you commit — this might be your wealth code.”



🏠 📈 💰 💼 SIDE INCOME, LONG TERM, INVESTMENT, STOCKS, PROPERTY
“So who belongs to the Investment Brain wealth code?
👉 Stars like Wu Qu, Tian Fu, Tai Yin, Wen Qu.
Wu Qu is resourceful and finance-driven — loves managing money.
Tian Fu is conservative — prefers safe and steady growth.
Tai Yin loves to save and values security.
Together, these stars are naturally drawn toward stability, numbers, and building assets over time.”




💰 THE BRANDING MAGNET
“YOUR BRAND IS YOUR POWER. THE WORLD PAYS THOSE WHO ARE SEEN AND REMEMBERED. 



“Now, let’s move into the third wealth code — the Branding Magnet.
These are the people with natural charisma. Wherever they go, they attract attention.
They build their wealth through influence and visibility. They know how to turn presence into opportunities.
If you’re someone who people naturally notice, who loves to express yourself, or who enjoys being in the spotlight — this might be your wealth code.”



🎤 ✨ 📸 🧲 CHARISMA, INFLUENCE, ATTENTION, BRANDING, VISIBILITY
“So who belongs to the Branding Magnet wealth code?
👉 Stars like Tan Lang, Ju Men, Tai Yang, Qi Sha, and Po Jun.
Tan Lang is charm and attraction — the classic social magnet.
Ju Men is the mouthpiece — persuasive, expressive, strong in communication.
Tai Yang is the sun — naturally shining, giving visibility and warmth.
Qi Sha is bold and daring — the kind of person who stands out because they take risks others won’t.
Po Jun is disruptive — they shake things up, challenge the norm, and leave a lasting impression.
Put together, these stars show someone who is born to be visible — to lead, to influence, and to turn their presence into opportunities.”



🤝 THE COLLABORATOR
YOU RISE BY HELPING & COLLABORATING WITH OTHERS - AND THEY BRING YOU WITH THEM.
“Now let’s move into the fourth wealth code — the Collaborator.
These are the people who shine when working with others. They don’t always want to do everything alone — their strength is finding the right people and creating win-win opportunities.
They build wealth by partnering, connecting, and leveraging networks. If you’re someone who prefers teamwork over solo hustle, who feels more energized when you’re collaborating — this might be your wealth code.”




🤝 👥 💼 📈 PARTNERSHIPS, LEVERAGE, NETWORKS, COLLABS, TEAM GROWTH
“So who belongs to the Collaborator wealth code?
👉 Stars like Zuo Fu, You Bi, Wen Chang, Wen Qu
Zuo Fu is the supportive helper — always there to guide or back you up.
You Bi is the alliance-builder — skilled at forming partnerships.
Wen Chang and Wen Qu are the brains of the team — great at communication, coordination, and refinement.
Together, these stars show someone who succeeds not by standing alone, but by multiplying strength through connection.”

South + South = Thoughtful but stuck
I know what I want, but I don’t move
🗣️ Script:
Have you ever had moments like this — where the plan is already set, the vision is clear, you know what you should do… but somehow… you never moved?
Not because you’re lazy. Not because you don’t care. In fact, you care deeply.
But it’s like something inside keeps pulling the brakes. You second guess. You overthink. You prepare, and prepare again. But when it’s time to act — you stall.
That’s South + South energy. Gentle. Stable. Wise. But if not balanced — it becomes stuck. You live a thoughtful life… but not a moved life.
You don’t want to settle for less — but if your chart lacks activation, you end up missing the window of destiny.
Sometimes, it’s not that your dreams are too far. It’s just your fire is too quiet.


265

North + North = Driven but Disconnected
I do so much, but I feel lost inside.
🗣️ Script:
Now let me flip the script. You’re not stuck. You’re doing everything. You’re trying. You’re building. You’re hustling like crazy — and yet… something’s still missing.
You’ve changed jobs, changed cities, changed partners — but the question still lingers: “Is this it?”
You thought being productive means being fulfilled. But somewhere along the way, you stopped hearing your own voice.
That’s North + North energy. Powerful. Fast. Ambitious. But if not grounded — it becomes restless.
And here’s the hardest part to admit: The world may clap for your success, but you… you feel disconnected from yourself.
You’ve been so busy chasing achievement — you forgot how to enjoy presence. You forgot the warmth of your children’s laughter, the peace of a quiet morning, the way your home feels when you slow down.
This is what happens when Yang energy burns too long without Yin.


266

Balance of north + south stars = True Strength
The North Stars (Bei Dou) represent strength and action; The South Stars (Nan Dou) represent softness and strategy.
If a person’s Life Palace and Body Palace are both filled with North Stars, their personality may become overly aggressive — best suited to charge ahead, like a warrior or general. If both are South Stars, they may be too soft — more suited as behind-the-scenes planners or advisors.
The ideal setup? A balance between North and South Stars — North in Life, South in Body, or vice versa. That creates someone who is both strong and adaptable — able to lead in battle, but also plan for peace.
The same applies to leadership and team building:
A great leader must embody both strength and flexibility, to expand when needed, and stabilize when required — that’s how you build and sustain a thriving organization.
Team members with strong North Star energy (more aggressive) should be placed in roles that break new ground or lead expansion.
Those with strong South Star energy (gentler) are better placed in support, maintenance, or admin functions.
When you understand this dynamic of North-South polarity, you’ll know how to read people and place them well — so your team can move like water: flexible outside, firm within. That’s what true strength looks like.

Turn knowledge into practical skills
Day 1: Clarity → First, you must understand the rules of the game. How does the system work? What do your cards actually mean? Without clarity, you’ll misplay from the start.
Day 2: Strategy → Once you know your hand, the question becomes: how do you play it? Do you flip it? Do you double it? Do you adjust your moves? That’s where strategy comes in.
Day 3: Breakthrough → Finally, you combine clarity and strategy to create your breakthrough. This is where you stop playing blindly and start playing to win.”

“These 3 days are super important — every session connects with the next one.
So make sure you’re committed to the full journey. If you didn’t manage to finish your pre-training or skip in between, then it’s gonna take you longer to catch up later.

PATTERN BASED READINGS
Zi Wei Dou Shu Unique Chart Interpretation
This part is just another extra layer of reading, ok? Some people have it, some people don’t — super normal.
Think of it like a birthmark. Got people born with one → cute bonus. Got people don’t have → also never die, right?
If you have it, shiok la — easier for people to notice you. If you don’t have, you won’t go around asking, “Eh why I no birthmark one ah?” Nobody does that.
So same thing here — this is just a bonus feature, not a must-have. Your chart still works perfectly fine.

*"Alright… now this one is very special — the Reversed Sun & Moon Formation. Normally, in a chart, the Sun is on top, the Moon is at the bottom. But for you… it’s the other way round — Moon is up here, Sun is hiding below.
What does that mean in real life? It means your day and night are flipped. You work when others are sleeping. You sleep when others are awake.
Most people with this formation end up doing rotational jobs, night shifts, or working with overseas markets like the US. Your routine is the same every day, you keep going and going… and it’s very easy to get tired or burnt out.
Not because you’re lazy — actually you work harder than most. But your body and life rhythm are always out of sync with the people around you.
So if this is you, remember one thing — you must create your own ‘sunrise’ time. Even if it’s just a short break or time for yourself, it’s what keeps your energy and passion alive."*

Suitable For:Anyone who wants long-term security or support, often attracts benefactors
*"Next, let’s look at Fu Xiang Chao Yuan Formation — I call this the Wealth Support Formation.
People with this chart… life is quite blessed. Your fortune is stable, and you rarely run out of resources. Even if you’re not working, somehow things still flow to you — maybe family helps, maybe partner supports, maybe you just naturally meet people who want to take care of you.
It’s like you always have a ‘financial cushion’ in life. Not saying you’ll become a billionaire overnight, but you’re not easily left with nothing.
And the best part? You often attract benefactors — people who are willing to guide you, sponsor you, or give you the resources you need to move forward.
So if you have this formation, don’t take it for granted. Use that stability to plan something bigger for yourself, instead of just enjoying the comfort.

Suitable For:Overseas roles, freelancers, migrant work, digital nomads
*"Now, this one… sounds a little mysterious — the Starless Destiny Formation. It means your Life Palace has no main stars.
Think of it like this — your ‘house’ has no owner staying inside. When the master is away, the home is left open… and what happens? It can attract good things… but it can also let bad things slip in.
In real life, it means you’re not meant to stay in one place. Your real opportunities are outside — in a different city, overseas, or even across the digital world. You thrive when you’re out there meeting people, exploring new markets, and building connections far from home.
But in the early part of life, it can feel tough. You might not have strong support, you learn independence the hard way, and you need to be alert — because just like an empty house, you must protect yourself from the wrong people or opportunities.
The magic of this formation? Once you step out, the world becomes your home. Overseas roles, freelancing, global clients — that’s where your luck really turns on."*

This formation is all about breakthroughs and big changes. Sometimes you win big, sometimes you crash hard — but you always move forward. It’s high-risk, high-reward energy.
In real life, this is perfect for entrepreneurs, sales, trading, or any job where you need to make bold moves in uncertain times. You’re the type who takes action while others are still thinking.
But remember — even the best generals know when to fight and when to step back. If you charge at every battle, you’ll burn out before you reach your biggest win."*

AI FREEDOM:The Trend You Must Ride
(The tool redefining how success is built)
Before we break for lunch, I want to show you something that could completely change how you work, create, and even think.
We’ve spent the last two and a half days decoding potential — your chart, your timing, your direction. But right now, I want to show you the trend that decides who actually moves faster in the real world.
I want to show you the tool that’s redefining how success is built.
You already know effort and skill matter. Yet look around — some people work just as hard, some even harder… but they’re not rising as fast.
It’s not luck. It’s trend.
Trends decide who rises — not effort alone.
Same skill, same effort, different wave — different result.
Today I’ll show you the wave that’s multiplying results across every industry. It’s called AI FREEDOM.


280

Trends decide who rises, not effort alone
Same skill x Same effort x Different wave = Different result
History proves this again and again. 
Your effort matters. Your skill matters. But timing and positioning on the right trend can multiply your results by 10x, 100x, or more. The question isn't whether you're working hard enough, it's whether you're riding on the right wave.
I keep saying this: Potential doesn’t make people successful — timing and trend do.
You can have the best chart, the best strategy, the strongest work ethic… but if you’re moving against the trend, you’ll always feel like you’re pushing uphill.
History proves this again and again.
When you move with the trend, things that used to take months suddenly take days or even minutes. That’s why some people seem to rise effortlessly — they’re not luckier, they’re just better aligned.
And right now, that alignment is about learning how to ride the biggest wave we’ve seen since the internet — artificial intelligence.
So effort matters. Skill matters. But timing and positioning on the right trend multiply results tenfold.
The real question isn’t “Am I working hard enough?” It’s “Am I riding the right wave?”

Every Generation Creates Wealth Through New Leverage
Intelligence (AI)
Era 3
Systems
Era 2
Manpower
Era 1
Era 1 · Manpower
Factories, farms, physical labor. Scale meant more hands, more hours, more bodies doing repetitive tasks.
Era 2 · Systems
Software, automation, processes. Scale meant better workflows, interconnected tools, optimized operations.
Era 3 · Intelligence
AI smart automation, creative leverage. Scale means augmented thinking, instant execution, exponential output.
We're at the beginning of Era 3. The wealth engine is shifting again. And you're early enough to ride it.
Let’s look at the pattern of how wealth is created.
Era 1 – Manpower. Factories, farms, physical labour. Scale meant more hands, more hours, more bodies.
Era 2 – Systems. Software, automation, processes. Scale meant better workflows and smarter tools.
Era 3 – Intelligence. AI agents, smart automation, creative leverage. Scale now means augmented thinking, instant execution, exponential output.
Each era didn’t just make people faster — it redefined what one person could achieve.
The cotton gin made each farmer fifty times more productive. Enterprise software made analysts process what once required departments.
AI won’t make you work harder — it will make your intelligence scalable.
We are right at the beginning of Era 3 — and you’re early enough to ride it.

AI = Intelligent Leverage
AI ≠ Coding
AI = Intelligent Leverage
(Speed × Quality)
Strategy Planner: Automate Routine Tasks
Email drafts, data entry, scheduling, handled in seconds.
Branding Magnet: Generate Designs & Content
Copywritings, presentations, social posts, graphics, created at the speed of thought.
Investment Brain: Analyze Data Instantly
Customer insights, trend analysis, performance reports, excels comprehended in moments, not days.
Collaborator: Summarize & Plan
Meeting notes, project briefs, strategic outlines, distilled and actionable immediately.
"What took DAYS now takes MINUTES."
Now, when people hear “AI,” they think coding, robots, engineers. In fact, you don’t need to know any coding stuff.
That’s outdated.
AI is intelligent leverage. It’s speed × quality.
It automates routine tasks — emails, scheduling, data entry. It generates designs and content — ads, captions, slides, visuals — at the speed of thought. It analyses data instantly — insights, reports, trends — all done in seconds. It summarises and plans — meetings, notes, outlines — ready to act immediately.
What used to take days, now takes minutes.
This isn’t about replacing your judgment; it’s about amplifying your decision speed.
AI does the first 80 percent — research, drafting, formatting — you focus on the final 20 percent — strategy, refinement, direction.
That’s leverage. That’s freedom.

If you’re thinking about starting a side gigs or business, you can even take this as a service, use AI to generate image or video and then sell it to those who need it. There’s a lot of ppl who are in the corporate world do not know how easy it is to use AI. you can easily charge them 100 bucks, 200 bucks per image or banner, not a problem, or maybe you can even charge other ppl by creating content for them, and it cost you like 30 minutes only? There’s so much more you can do with AI these days.
No waiting, no big team, no delay.
That’s how work gets done today by those who’ve mastered AI leverage.
Imagine shrinking a week-long project into half an hour.Not only save time, but also save labor, save hassle, save money.
That’s not “someday.” That’s today.
And those who learn to command this tool… operate in a different reality.

90 days of Social Media Content
Let me show you what this looks like behind the scenes.
What used to take 3 days now takes 30 minutes, same campaign scope, same person, same quality.
Three days of research, copywriting, design, tech setup — collapsed into half an hour through prompt-based workflows and automation.
That’s a 144× speed gain.
Not because we hired more people — but because the same operator used smarter leverage.
This is what changes business models. When competitors are still planning, you’re already delivering.

SEE · If you can show it, don't describe it
Image/Screenshot → Understanding. Stop writing lengthy explanations. Capture what you see, upload it, and AI extracts meaning, identifies patterns, and suggests actions. Visuals replace paragraphs.
3
REMEMBER · If AI can store it, don't memorize it
Record → Summary → Action List. Let AI maintain perfect recall of meetings, conversations, and decisions. Your brain focuses on insight and strategy, not retention. Memory becomes searchable and shareable.
Old Workflow
Type every word manually
Write detailed descriptions
Memorize key information
Reconstruct from notes
Hours of cognitive overhead
New Workflow
Speak, AI writes
Show, AI understands
Record, AI remembers
Query, AI retrieves
Minutes of focused direction
Talk · Show · Store = Explosive Efficiency
The way we work is changing. Old rule: type everything, describe everything, memorise everything. New rule: Hear, See, Remember.
Rule 1 — Hear: if you can say it, don’t type it. Speak naturally, and AI writes for you. Thinking speed becomes writing speed.
Rule 2 — See: if you can show it, don’t describe it. Snap a picture, upload it, AI understands visuals better than paragraphs.
Rule 3 — Remember: if AI can store it, don’t memorise it. Let AI record, summarise, and recall so your brain stays focused on insight and creativity.
Talk · Show · Store = Explosive Efficiency.
You shift from typing and explaining… to thinking and executing.

Reality Check
"You will see massive shifts in white-collar work."
— Barack Obama
You won't be replaced by AI.
You'll be replaced by someone who knows AI.
The question isn't whether this shift will affect your industry — it's whether you'll be leading it or scrambling to catch up. Those who master AI leverage today will define the competitive standards tomorrow. Those who wait will find themselves explaining why they're slower and more expensive than alternatives.
“You will see massive shifts in white-collar work.” — Barack Obama spoke about this in a public tv news.
You won’t be replaced by AI. You’ll be replaced by someone who knows how to use AI.
It’s already happening — law firms review contracts in minutes, agencies build campaigns ten times faster, consultants analyse data that once took whole teams.
The shift isn’t coming — it’s here.
Those who learn AI leverage now will define tomorrow’s standards. Those who wait will explain later why they’re slower and more expensive.
Don’t wait to adapt when the wave’s already passed. Catch it while it’s still building.

292

Wealth Principle for the AI Era
Learn Once
Master the prompts, workflows, and systems that unlock AI leverage.
Leverage Daily
Apply these tools every single day to compound your productivity gains.
Multiply for Years
The skills you build now create compounding advantages for your entire career.
Every prompt you master = a future shortcut working for you.
Learn once. Leverage daily. Multiply for years. This is the new wealth-building formula, and you're early enough to maximize it.
Here’s how you turn this into real advantage: Learn Once · Leverage Daily · Multiply for Years.
Every prompt, every AI you master today becomes a shortcut that works for you tomorrow.
Learn it once — use it every day — compound it for years.
That’s how small time-savers turn into huge opportunity multipliers.
 The earlier you learn the leverage points, the further ahead you stay.This is the new wealth-building formula, and you're early enough to maximize it.

Many of you asked:
“Is there a course related to AI for a beginner?”

Meet CMC — Our CMO & CTO
Builder of AI-Powered Operations
This is the person who built our entire AI-powered marketing team and operations infrastructure from the ground up — the same systems that collapsed 3-day workflows into 30-minute executions.
Trusted by Top Founders
CMC has worked with leading creators and founders across Malaysia and Singapore, implementing AI systems that transformed their operational capacity and competitive positioning.
Proven Track Record
Turned "days of work" into "minutes of execution" — not as a one-time demonstration, but as a repeatable, teachable system that others can implement.
Dual Expertise
Combines deep technical knowledge (CTO perspective) with strategic marketing insight (CMO perspective) — understanding both the "how" and the "why" behind AI leverage.
You're learning from someone who does this work daily, not someone who talks about it theoretically. 
Let me properly introduce CMC - the CMO & CTO of our company.
He’s not someone teaching theory — he’s the builder of our AI-powered marketing and operations backbone.
He personally worked along with some of the top influencers & biz owners across Malaysia and Singapore.He turned “days of work” into “minutes of execution.”
And he’s teaching not what he read, but what he builds — every single day.
Technical depth + marketing strategy = a rare mix that produces results you can measure.

You've seen the pattern. You've seen the proof. You've seen the opportunity. The only question now is whether you'll take action while the window is open  or explain later why you waited.
The Trend
AI is the leverage engine of this generation. It's not coming, it's here. Those who master it early will define the next decade of competitive advantage.
The Timing
You're early enough to build insurmountable leads. Late enough that the tools actually work. This is the perfect moment, proven capabilities, limited competition.
The Freedom
Freedom to execute faster. Freedom to compete bigger. Freedom to deliver more without burning out. Freedom to ride the wave instead of swimming against it.
Let’s tie this together.
The Trend — AI is the leverage engine of our generation. The Timing — you’re early enough to gain, late enough that the tools actually work. The Freedom — freedom to execute faster, compete bigger, deliver more, and never burn out.
The people who thrive in the next five years aren’t the most talented — they’re the ones who understand intelligent leverage and act early.
So, be someone who acts.

🌟🌟🌟
FLYING STARS 
= VARIABLES 
Heavenly stem
Draw in chart, 10 tian gan
2 repetitive 
Everyone has different bazi, so your 10 HEAVENLY STEM will locate differently
Earthly branch is fixed, but heavenly stem is not, thats why not everyone having the same season, or the same cycle - even they’re borned on the same day
Even if you have the same heavenly stem order, luck also diff as the stars inside gonna be different too
Even la heavenly stem + stars ALSO SAME, AGE also not same, experience also different 
Recap: earthly branch is fixed, but heavenly stem is not because everyone birth time is different 
Everyone’s jia is different, but must be clockwise order
Show chart this person jia is here, so clockwise is jia yi bing ding…TG only got 10, so got 2 will repeat like this ren gui ren gui
Tian gan will generate = 4 activation (lu quan ke ji)
Every year tian gan is different, so lu quan ke ji will be different - luck & direction also different 
Lu quan ke ji each is what…
Every year diff > thats why different ups and downs 
Dont care about the meaning first i will teach later
Now you only need to know tian gan will generate 4 diff activations which is…
REAL CHANGER = TIAN GAN 
Lu quan ke ji fall in diff palace diff stars every year 
Obvious activation = generate by your birth year tian gan 
Understand difference between di zhi VS tian gan

"Let me explain Lu, Quan, Ke, Ji in a way everyone can understand — using football.
First — Lu. Lu is your striker. This is the guy who scores the goals. When Lu is on your side, opportunities come in smooth, money flows in, and it feels like you’re always at the right place at the right time. Your job? Pass the ball to Lu and let him shoot. Don’t block him.
Then — Quan. Quan is your team captain. He’s got the authority, the power, the control of the field. When Quan is active, you naturally step into leadership roles, people listen to you, and you call the shots. But remember — a captain can lead the team to victory… or to chaos if ego gets in the way.
Next — Ke. Ke is your defender or support system. This is the one who protects your reputation, builds your fame, brings noble people to help you. Ke makes sure you don’t just play the game — you look good doing it. When Ke’s strong, you get backup from the right people at the right time.
And finally — Ji. Ji is your goalkeeper… but here’s the twist — In football, the goalkeeper saves goals. In Zi Wei Dou Shu, Ji is more like the warning sign. It tells you where the leaks are — where money might get lost, where insufficiency happens, where trouble can slip in if you’re not careful. You can’t ignore Ji. If your goalkeeper is weak, even the best striker can’t save the match.
So when you look at your chart — You’re basically looking at your football team. Some people have a killer striker but a shaky goalkeeper — they make money fast but lose it just as fast. Some have a solid captain and defender but no striker — lots of control and reputation, but no real cash flow. Your job is to know your team… and play your strategy right."

Compared to Case Study 1, this one is definitely stronger. Why? Because in Case 1, the wealth rules only show up in Liu Nian, which means it only applies for a short period — just one year.
But here in Case 2, the wealth rules are in Dayun, which covers a much longer timeframe — a whole 10 years.
On top of that, this chart also carries a self-enhancer, which makes the energy about three times stronger, and the palace itself holds strong stars.
That means no matter what this person chooses to do during this cycle, the results will be very good for him.

Timeframe → Palaces 
→ Activations → Stars
ALWAYS start with a GOAL/ QUESTION 
**“When you read a chart, always follow this flow: Timeframe → Palaces → Activations → Stars.
Step 1: Always start with a clear goal and timeframe. For example: Is 2025 suitable for me to start my own business? Or Am I suitable to build my property business long term?
Step 2: Once your purpose and timeline are set, identify the most relevant palace.
Step 3: Now you decide how to read it:
If the palace has key stars inside, interpret directly from those stars.
If the palace is empty, or you want more options and clarity, then check the flying stars or activations (Lu, Quan, Ke, Ji) to see how the energy plays out.
Step 4: Finally, layer the interpretation. The stars inside the palace give you the direct answer, while the flying stars and activations add timing, opportunities, and extra dimensions.
So remember: timeframe first, then palace, then choose — direct star reading or flying star activations — depending on the situation. That way, your reading stays focused, practical, and always answers your exact question.”

Okay, so at this point you’ve probably realised — Zi Wei is not something you can just “see once and remember forever”.
The chart got 12 palaces, 10+ stars, 4 transformations, 大限 flying here and there… If you try to track all this manually? Confirm headache.
That’s why we didn’t just leave you with slides or notes. We actually built a tool for this.
So you can check your chart, track your timing, know which palace is active — all with just a few clicks. No more guessing. No more flipping pages. Just clean clarity.
Who here would actually use this if I gave you full access? Type YES in the chat if you’re excited to check it out.
(wait 2–3 seconds for chat to react)
Now — the guy who made this whole thing possible… is someone I trust fully when it comes to tech and making my life easier.
He’s the brain behind the software, the one who turns all this logic into something you can actually use.
His name is Stanley — he’s our tech lead, our backend brain, and also the reason I don’t lose my mind dealing with codes 😂
So I’m gonna let him take over for a bit and show you how to access the software with full features, so you don’t just learn Zi Wei — you actually live it.
Stanley, take it away.

Let's Play A Game!

Your Journey Through Life Decisions
Career • Wealth • Love • Health • Fulfillment
You’ll walk through 10 life-changing decisions... from age 18 to 80.
Every choice you make will shift your destiny score.
Behind the scenes, your chart will quietly judge you. Some paths will align. Some will cost you.
At the end, your soul journey will be revealed. What you chased. What you ignored. And who you truly are.
This is no longer a theory session.
It’s your life compressed into 10 powerful crossroads.
Let’s put the chart aside for a moment.
This part is not about analyzing stars or memorizing meanings. This is about how you move through life. What you prioritize. What you ignore. And what you sacrifice — often without even realizing.
Because the truth is… your chart might tell you where the doors are. But only you decide which ones to walk through.
In this simulation, you’ll face 10 real-life moments — from age 18 to 60. Each one mirrors the kind of decisions we all face in life: Do I chase money? Do I stay for love? Do I follow passion… or play it safe?
Every answer you choose will shift your score across five areas: Career, Wealth, Love, Health, and Fulfillment.
Now here’s the twist: You won’t see your chart during this game. But your chart is still calculating in the background.
Some of your choices will align perfectly. Others will cost you — silently, without warning.
And by the end, you’ll see the full picture:
What path you walked
What parts of life you mastered
And what parts you left behind
This is no longer a knowledge test. It’s a self-awareness test.
So don’t overthink it. Be honest. Be brave. And begin your journey.

Understanding Your Results
No Perfect Score
Only honest choices with natural trade-offs
Stars Reveal, Not Judge
Your chart reflects alignment, not punishment
Recognize Your Pattern
Identify what you truly prioritize in life
Alright…
You’ve just lived a lifetime in 10 choices. And even though it was just a simulation… Your decisions weren’t random. They came from somewhere real.
From habits you’ve repeated. Stories you’ve believed. Goals you’ve chased — sometimes without even asking why.
Now here’s the truth: There is no perfect score. There’s no version where you win every area of life without trade-offs. But what your journey revealed… Is what you consistently prioritized. What you were willing to sacrifice. And what you kept avoiding — maybe for years.
Some of you always chased freedom. Some clung to safety. Some let go of love too easily. Some kept health at the very bottom… again.
And here’s where it gets real…
Do you remember what we did on Day 1? Goal setting.
Some of you probably thought: “Why start with that?” But now you see — that one decision you made, about what you thought you wanted... was already shaping the way you played this entire game.
Your goal is the anchor of your life. It pulls everything else into orbit. What you read. What you filter. What you tolerate. And eventually… what you lose.
You can have the best Zi Wei chart in the world. But if your focus is wrong… You’ll still walk the wrong path.
That’s why this system isn’t about stars. It’s about direction. It’s about seeing where you’re headed — before life pulls you somewhere you never meant to go.
This game didn’t just show you what’s possible. It showed you what’s been happening all along.
And now that you’ve seen it…
You can’t unsee it.
[Short pause, change tone slightly softer]
So here’s what I want you to do.
Just take a minute — Sit with your result. And drop in the chat:
What part of the game resonate with you the most? Was there a decision you regret? A pattern you didn’t realise until now?
No overthinking. No right or wrong. Just real answers
This is the moment most people avoid. But this is also where real clarity begins.
Let me know in the chat, what realisation do you get from this simulation game? Just a quick one will do


335

Now the next thing, i wanna share with you…
When you watch a movie, how does it come out? You need three things — No.1 the actor, No.2 the script, and No.3 the director, right?
Now let me ask you — if you want to control how the story goes, who decides it? The actor or the director?
It’s the director, right?
Both actor and director are important — the actor looks good on screen, gets famous, gets applause — but everything the actor says and does is already written inside the script.
Your Zi Wei chart is that script.
So today, you have two choices — you can continue being the actor, just following what’s written, hardly memorize the stars meaning, ask a yes or no question or you can become the director, read your own script, and rewrite your story the way you want.
Whether you follow it… or change it — depends on YOU today.

🎭 THE ACTOR MINDSET
Now, you might be thinking — “CAE, I really want to be the director of my life, but sometimes I really got no choice… so how?”
Let’s break it down. After consulting for thousands of people — business owners,professionals, high achievers, managers, employees, even retirees — I realised one thing: there’s a clear pattern behind those who keep getting stuck.
I call this the Actor Triangle Mindset.
Actors usually have three main traits.

Thinking
1️⃣ Dependable Thinking (托付思想)
“Dependable” here doesn’t mean being loyal or caring. It means you always wait for someone or something to decide for you.
Just like an actor, you need approval from director to say CUT right
Its the same in your real life - 
You depend on your boss to give you a raise instead of asking for it. You wait for your husband or wife to change first before you do. You tell yourself, “Let’s wait until I’m 100% ready.”
But here’s the truth — life doesn’t wait for your readiness.
This is human nature but why it happens? This mindset comes from fear — fear of taking responsibility, fear of making the wrong move, fear of what happens after you decide.
And because of that fear, you give away your power.

2️⃣ Self-Righteous Thinking (自以为是)
This is when you always believe your way is the only right way. You measure everything with your own standards. You talk in absolutes — “People should listen to me.” “Things should be done this way.”
For example, parents — when your kids don’t listen, you confiscate their phone or laptop, thinking they’ll magically become obedient. Or business owners — when your team doesn’t perform, you scold them instead of understanding what’s really blocking them.
This mindset closes your learning channel. It turns growth into control. And the more you try to control, the more life resists you.

3️⃣ Self-Limiting Thinking (自我限制)
This is when you shrink your own possibilities before life even challenges you.
You say things like: “I’m too old already.” “I have no connections.” “I’m not extroverted like others.” “I don’t have resources.”
“I don’t have good chart, i miss my wealth windows”
So instead of finding a way, you find a reason.
Employees use it to justify why they stay stuck. Retirees use it to justify why they can’t restart. Business owners use it to justify why they can’t scale.
But all of it comes down to the same belief: “I can’t.”

Actors keep saying,
“One day things will change.” But they never do anything different.
They let life push them around like background characters — waiting for the next line, the next scene, the next “maybe.”
But life doesn’t reward actors. Life rewards directors.

🗣️ THE POWER OF LANGUAGE
People who truly succeed in life —
all have one thing in common.
They’ve mastered the Power of Language.
Do you know what’s the most loyal thing in the world?
It’s not your spouse, not your boyfriend, not your girlfriend, not your husband or wife.
It’s your brain.
Your brain works like a supercompueter, it's programmed to keep you save & consistent
so whatever you say to yourself,
no matter it’s good or bad,
it listens 100%, believes everything you say about yourself
our brain also has something calll cognitive bias - it means When you make a statement, your brain looks for evidence to support that narrative, rather than trying to disprove it.
That’s why I always say:
What you say today… becomes what you see.
If you keep saying,
“I’m unlucky.”
“I’m not good enough.”
“My chart not strong.”
Even if you hold the strongest chart in the world, even if you’re in spring cycle, or summer cycle now 
your brain will actually find proof to make it true.
But when you speak power,
when you say,
“I’ll figure this out.”
“I can learn this, i know it’s hard, but i will master it one day”
“My timing is opening — I just need to act,”
your mind, your energy, and your chart start working for you, not against you.
so how you gonna do it exactly - this one single practice that i literally doing everyday also changed my entire life , how many of you wanna know my secret formula?
that is...Asking Better Questions
Because your questions decide your focus,
and your focus decides your power.
Your power decides your money.
Most people ask questions that trap them.
They ask:
“Why is this happening to me?”
“Why is my luck so bad?”
“Why can’t my boss / client / spouse understand me?”
Some even ask —
“When am I going to die?”
Your language decides your power.
If you keep asking fearful, negative questions,
you’ll get fearful, negative answers.
and your brain will consistently prove to you that - YES YOU'RE FEARFUL & YOU'RE INCAPABLE NOW
Whether you’re living a good life or a bad life right now
depends entirely on the quality of your questions.
Instead of asking:
“Why is my luck so bad?”
“When will this suffering end?”
Ask:
“How can I maximise my 2025?”
“How can I be a better parent?”
“How can I be a better spouse?”
“What is this trying to teach me?”
“What can I do differently next time?”
When you change your questions,
you change your focus.
When you change your focus,
you activate your power.
And when you activate your power —
your chart finally starts opening doors for you.
Because destiny doesn’t move for victims.
It moves for directors —
people who speak power, not pity.
So from today onwards,
watch your words.
Change your questions.
And start commanding your chart —
not complaining to it.

🧩 THE SOLUTION SEEKER
One thing I’ve noticed about people who actually move forward in life — they’re not the ones who feel less, they’re the ones who solve more.
Because here’s the truth — if you always fall into your emotions, then every decision you make will come from emotions.
And emotions? They don’t fix problems — they only make the problem feel bigger.
Solution seekers are different. They don’t waste time being stuck. They shift from “Why me?” to “What’s next?”

They focus on solutions, not feelings.
When something goes wrong, actors complain, blame, or give up. Directors look for solutions.
They ask,
“Okay, what’s the real issue here?” “What can I control right now?” “What’s one small step I can take to make it better?”
Let me give you a simple example — in this class, I always say: “Best experience is through a laptop or PC.”
A solution seeker will go — “Alright, I’ll borrow one, I’ll set it up, I’ll make it work.”
But someone stuck in emotion will say — “Wah, so strict ah? Why got so many rules?”
You see the difference?
One looks for possibility, the other looks for excuse.

They take emotion as data, not direction.
Directors also feel angry, disappointed, scared — but they use that emotion as information, not instruction.
They don’t make big decisions when they’re emotional. They breathe, pause, and ask,
“Okay, what’s the lesson here?” “What’s the solution here?”
Because if you want to change your life, you can’t let emotions drive the car. You must let strategy drive, and let emotions sit in the backseat.

They adapt fast.
When life throws something unexpected — solution seekers don’t argue with reality. They adapt.
Business owner — ad not working? Change the offer. Employee — manager unreasonable? Improve skill or find better fit. Retiree — market different now? Learn something new, try new rhythm.
They don’t wait for perfect timing; they create better timing through movement.

That’s why solution seekers always end up one step ahead. Because while everyone else is complaining, they’re already calibrating.
So from today onwards, every time something feels hard, don’t ask, “Why is this happening to me?” Ask, “How can I solve this faster?”
Because life doesn’t reward those who react — it rewards those who resolve.

VISIONER
What’s my life vision?

🌍 THE VISIONER
A person’s true achievement depends on how many people they want to take care of.
If your only goal is to make money, you’ll get emotional easily — money comes, money goes.
But when you have a vision, your drive becomes unstoppable.
Look at great companies — Tesla wants to change how the world uses energy. Google wants to organize the world’s information.
My vision? To help 100 million people use metaphysics to multiply their wealth and gain back control of their lives.
If you don’t have a dream, then honestly — “没有梦想跟咸鱼有什么分别.”
Now, some people say, “But my dream feels too big, I’m scared I can’t reach it.”
That’s normal. Your vision isn’t supposed to make you comfortable — it’s supposed to remind you why you started.
Because when you feel lost, tired, or want to give up, your vision is what pulls you back on track.
It’s not just a goal — it’s your engine.

CHAMPION
Am I able to make a 
comeback?
🏆 THE CHAMPION MINDSET
Champions aren’t the people who never fall. They’re the people who refuse to stay down.
They’ve been rejected, betrayed, embarrassed, judged, but no matter how many times life pushes them, they keep standing up — again and again.
Because here’s the truth — everyone gets tested. The difference is, actors break when life gets hard. Directors bounce back.
They don’t say “Why me?” They say “Try me.”

Champions turn pain into fuel.
They know pain is part of the process. Every failure, every loss, every delay — is data. It’s feedback. It’s a reminder that they’re still in the game.
They might pause to catch their breath, but they don’t give up the fight.
They keep learning, keep adjusting, keep growing. They stay true to who they are — because their identity doesn’t depend on success; their identity creates success.

Champions always come back stronger.
When they fail, they ask,
“What’s this teaching me?” “What can I do better next time?”
When things collapse, they don’t quit — they rebuild.
A failed launch becomes a new strategy. A lost job becomes a better direction. A heartbreak becomes a stronger boundary.
That’s why champions always rise higher — because every setback becomes their training ground.

Champions win from within.
They don’t chase validation. They don’t live by people’s opinions. They live by conviction.
They trust that timing and effort will meet — and when it does, the world will finally see what they’ve been building quietly.
That’s why I always tell my students — you don’t need to be the loudest. You just need to be the most consistent.
Because success doesn’t come to those who move fast. It comes to those who keep moving, even when no one is watching.

So when life hits you — don’t act like a victim. Don’t act like an extra in someone else’s movie.
Take the hit. Learn from it. Then come back and rewrite the scene.
That’s what a real champion does.

🎁 Bonus #3 
Monthly Coaching Call
December 18 - Saturday @ 8:30pm
Jan 17 (2026) - Saturday @ 8:30pm
Let me set a clear expectation for all of you moving forward.
Over the past three days, I’ve already taught you the full Zi Wei system — the entire framework is complete. But the truth is this: everyone’s situation is different. Your timing, your chart, your struggles, your opportunities… they’re not the same.
That’s why the Coaching Calls are extremely important.
Every month, we run a Hot Seat Session. You’ll submit your questions beforehand, and we’ll look at what the majority of you are facing — whether it’s timing, career decisions, business direction, relationships, or chart interpretation. Then during the Coaching Call, I’ll break it down, highlight the patterns, and go deeper into what actually matters.
And if you want me to go deeper into your specific situation or a more advanced layer, just submit your Hot Seat early — once it’s shortlisted, I’ll address it in the call with full depth.
Now here’s the key point:
Zi Wei is a living system. As your life keeps moving, you face new things every day — different challenges, different opportunities, different inspirations. And because life doesn’t stay still, your guidance shouldn’t stay still either.
That’s why the Coaching Call matters. It keeps your momentum alive, helps you adjust, and supports you to navigate your day-to-day with clarity and confidence.
So show up, participate, submit your Hot Seat — That’s how you make every single day work for you, not against you.

Congrats on coming this far!
You didn't just learn a system. You took your power back.
Stop slide and read script:

Alright. Before we end, let’s just land this together.
You didn’t come here just to play with some stars. You didn’t sit through 3 days just to learn a system. You came here because deep down — you’re tired of pretending you’re okay with “just surviving.”
You know you want more. Not just more money. But more clarity. More peace. More certainty.
You want to wake up and finally feel like… “Yes. I’m on track.” You want to stop second-guessing every move. Stop wondering if you’re wasting your time. Stop chasing goals that don’t even belong to you.
Because let’s be real — you’ve been pushing hard, but sometimes you’re not even sure why. You look successful on the outside… but inside? You’re exhausted. Not because you’re weak — But because you’ve been running without direction.
That’s what Zi Wei gave you these past 3 days.
This system didn’t give you a prediction. It gave you a pattern. It showed you how you’ve been moving… And who you could become if you stopped operating on autopilot.
And the moment you saw your chart, the moment you ran that simulation… You already knew — you can’t move the same after this.
Because now? Now you know your cycle. You know your exact timing. You know which palace is open. You know what path is asking to be walked — and what path needs to be let go.
This isn’t about motivation. This isn’t about working harder. This is about walking in alignment.
When you’re in the right season… You don’t have to force. You don’t have to beg. You don’t have to “hope things work out.”
You just move. And things start to click.
That’s what we did here.
✅ You faced your truth. ✅ You saw your timing. ✅ You remembered your path. ✅ And now you know what it feels like to move with power — not pressure.
So from this moment forward, I need you to stop shrinking. Stop waiting for “the right time.” You are the right time.
And one more thing…
This skill? This clarity? This alignment you’ve felt?
It’s not just for you.
Because the moment you master this, you’ll start seeing other people drifting too.
Your friends. Your team. Your family. You’ll see them stuck in cycles they don’t even know they’re in. And you’ll realise — you hold something that could change that.
So don’t keep this to yourself.
Use it. Live it. And when you're ready — go out there and guide others back to their path too.
Because this world doesn’t just need more success. It needs more alignment. And you? You're already walking it.
You already have the map.
Now move like someone who knows where they’re going.
That’s how you design your destiny. I’ll see you — at your next activation point.
